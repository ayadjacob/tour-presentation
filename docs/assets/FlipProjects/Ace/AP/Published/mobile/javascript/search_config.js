(b) For the smaller value of k found in part (a), find the value of b for which f is a                      continuous function.

Therefore, for f to have a finite limit at x = k, k must be a root of                       2                      x   2x  3. Hence, the possible values of k are 1 and 3.                      Moreover, both of the values found above are accepted, as in each case the rational                                  x   2  2x   3                      expression             simplifies to a linear one, and thus, the negative side limit at                                                                           x k                      x = k of f is finite.                    (b) The smaller value of k is 1.                      f  is a continuous function for all x  1.

(a) Find the value of f (0).                    (b) Show that f is odd. Check the parity of h(x) = (sinx) f (x).

Solution:                   (a) f (0) = f (0 + 0) = f (0) + f (0) = 2f (0)                      This gives f (0) = 0.                    (b) For any real x we have: f (0) = f (x  x) = f (x) + f (x).                      But f (0) = 0. This gives f (x) = f (x), which means that f is odd.                      h(x) = (sin(x))f (x) = (sinx)(f (x)) = (sinx)f (x) = h(x). Hence, h is even.
