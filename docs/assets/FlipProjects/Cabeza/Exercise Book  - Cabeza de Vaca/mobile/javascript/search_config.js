They lived in permanent settlements which looked like apartment complexes. In his                memoir,  La  Relacion,  Alvar  spoke  of  arrowheads  made  of  emeralds  that  were                offered  to  him  by  the  tribesmen.  Inspired  by  Alvar’s  account,  Spanish  explorer                Francisco de Coronado came to explore the legendary “Seven Cities of Cibola” of                New  Mexico  and  Arizona.  They  had  acquired  the  name  “Seven  Cities  of  Gold”                because  they  were  believed  to  have  invaluable  treasures.  To  his  great                disappointment, he found nothing but Zuñi villages.                                                    1. Who are the Zuñi?                         2.

What is the moral of Cabeza de Vaca?                                 2. Can we say that this moral is also the theme of Cabeza de Vaca? Why?                         Journal (page 118)                    Read the passage below and answer the questions.                            Alvar  watched  the  sun  set  over  the  land  where  he  had  wandered,  and  his                   heart was flooded suddenly with memories and sadness for all the friends he had                   lost and was leaving behind.  He turned to the east and thought of Spain and all the                   things he wanted to say to the king.   “I will teach the world to conquer through                   gentleness and love,” he whispered.  For the first time in years, he looked to the                   future with hope.  He felt like a Conquistador again.                         1. Alvar  has  gone  full  circle.  He  now  feels  like  a  Conquistador  again  after                          having  abandoned  that  role  many  years  ago.  In  your  opinion,  how  would                          Alvar be different from the other Conquistadors?"];
