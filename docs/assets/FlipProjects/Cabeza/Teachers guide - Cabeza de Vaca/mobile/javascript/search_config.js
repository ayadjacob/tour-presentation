Europeans were trying to find new                                  trade routes to the Far East from where they imported silk and spices, valuable                                  commodities at the time. Silk was used to make fine clothing and spices kept food                                  from spoiling. Europeans had so far relied on the Silk Road, a long and dangerous                                  route linking Europe with China. The rulers of Europe started to fund explorations         to find new sea routes to Asia.                                    Portugal was the first European country that sent explorers to search for new                                  ways to reach China. However, other countries quickly followed and competition                                  soon started between European neighbors. Christopher Columbus wanted to                                  find a shortcut to China by sailing west. When Portugal refused to fund his trip,                                  he went to the rulers of Spain, who gave him money. His discovery of a new                                  continent on this now legendary trip brought glory to Spain. Other European         countries such as France, England, and Holland later joined the competition to conquer new lands in the         New World.                        Who are some famous European explorers? What did they discover?                       Italian-born Christopher Columbus sailed west from Spain in 1492 on an expedition funded                       by the King and Queen of Spain. After a long and difficult journey, he arrived at the island                       of Hispanola. Thinking he was near the coast of China, he named the Caribbean islands the                       West Indies. Columbus claimed the new lands he discovered for Spain. He never reached                       mainland North and South America, which were later discovered by a flurry of explorers         who followed him to the New World.                              Vasco Da Gama was a Portuguese explorer who sailed to India by going around Africa.                            He was the first to cross an all-water sea route from Europe to India. In 1497, he sailed                            from Portugal, crossed the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, and went on to India. It                            took him ten months to complete his journey.                               Ferdinand Magellan was another explorer from Portugal. Instead of heading east like                            other explorers, Magellan decided to explore the possibility of reaching the Far East                            by sailing west around South America. He left Spain in 1519 with nearly 250 men and                            four ships. Three years later, only one ship returned carrying 18 men. Magellan was not                            one of them. Although the trip cost him his life, Magellan became famous as the first                            explorer who sailed across the world.                                     Great civilizations and empires thrived in the New World. Among them were                                 the Aztecs of present-day Mexico and the Incas of the country of Peru. These                                 two peoples led an advanced way of life which ended abruptly after they were                                 conquered by Europe. The Aztecs were formidable engineers. They built a                                 magnificent capital, Tenochtitlan, which was larger than any European city at         the time. The Incas built a complex road system and created new agricultural methods including terraced         farming.","2                          While Reading                      Pronunciation          *          Pay particular attention to the following words:         “conquistador” (kon-kwis-tuh-dawr, kong),         “islands” (ahy-luh ndz), “vineyards” (vin-yerdz),          “livestock” (lahyv-stok), and Spaniard (span-yerd).                        Vocabulary         Teaching Point: Style and Language          Use knowledge of the meaning of individual         words to predict the meaning of unknown         compound words.          Predict the meaning of the compound word         port-city using your knowledge of the         individual words.            Each word can be broken down into two.          Determine the definitions of the words in the         compound then the meaning of the new word.          Port means a harbor.         City means a large town.         A port-city therefore is a large town with a         harbor.          Teaching Point: Style and Language          Determine the meaning of unfamiliar words         using context clues.          Without looking at their dictionaries, students         should infer the meaning of “plantation” and         “Conquistador” using context clues.           Context clues are usually close to where the         unfamiliar word appears. The meaning of a word         can be guessed based on a direct definition, a         synonym, or the general context of a sentence.          Hint          For plantation, infer the meaning from the         general context.          A plantation is a place where grapes and         maybe other crops are grown, farm animals         live, and slaves do the manual work.         Therefore, it is a large farm or estate.          For Conquistador, look for a direct definition.          Explain the words in the dictionary,         focusing on those in the vocabulary list, as         they come up in the reading.                 *  see appendix for the pronunciation guide                     4","3                                                                              Geography                                                                         The Canary Islands                                              As a child, Alvar had a vivid                                                  imagination.

Biography: Hernando Cortes                                                                                                         A          Hernando Cortes (1485-1587) was the         Spanish explorer who became famous         for leading the expedition that started the         conquest of Mexico. He was part of the         first generation of European explorers who         began the colonization of the New World.         The gold and riches that he discovered         in the Aztec empire inspired many other         explorers to follow his steps.         In 1519, leading a small force, Cortes         peacefully entered the Aztec capital of         Tenochtitlan, rich in gold and other         treasures. The Aztecs soon rebelled against         the Spanish presence, but their revolt was         brutally crushed. Cortes quickly became         a hero in Spain because of the riches he         sent home. As a reward, the king of Spain         appointed Cortes governor of Mexico.         However, the King became suspicious         of Cortes’ ambitions and sent officials         to Mexico to investigate his actions and         ruthlessness toward the Natives. In 1528,         Cortes was ordered to return to Spain. He         was later sent back to Mexico but was         never reappointed governor. He died in         Spain in 1587.                                                                                            6","5                                                                              Discussion                                                                            Teaching Point: Characterization                                                                        Identify the main character.
