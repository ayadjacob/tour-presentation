This port-city had                               special meaning for Alvar because his grandfather had                               conquered these same islands for Spain forty years before.                               His grandfather had brought back many amazing stories and                               treasures from his adventures.  Also, his grandfather had                              brought back several slaves who were native to the Canary                               Islands.  These people were lean and muscular, with bronze-                               colored skin.  They picked grapes in the vineyards and tended                               the livestock on Alvar’s grandfather’s plantation.  As a boy,                               Alvar used to imagine the strange land from which these                              slaves were taken.  Now he saw the Canary Islands with his                               own eyes, and understood what had inspired his grandfather to                               claim them for Spain so many years ago.                                      Like his grandfather and all the other men on his ship,                               Alvar was a Conquistador: a Spaniard who sailed to all known                              corners of the globe in search of riches and new lands to                               claim.  Just thirty-five years had passed since Christopher                                                                3","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               Columbus first set foot in what Europeans called the New                             World.  Eager explorers from Europe quickly set sail for the                             New World, hoping to discover gold, spices, and other riches.                             Alvar was a one-year-old when Columbus set sail.  By the                             time Alvar was ten, his head was filled with stories about the                            distant New World with all its mysteries: cities of gold, tribes                             of cannibals, exotic animals, and fields of spice.  As he grew,                             he dreamed of joining the Conquistadors.  Now, at the age of                             thirty-six, his dream was close to coming true.  He was not in                             the New World yet, but being in the Canary Islands meant that                            he was getting closer.                                    Alvar was part of a mighty expedition, of five ships                             and over six hundred men.  The expedition’s leader was                             Governor Panfilo de Narvaez.  When they had set sail from                             Sanlucar, Spain—the same port from which Columbus had set                            sail—thousands of people had gathered to wish them good                             luck.  The crews of all five ships sent out a great cheer, and                             their high spirits continued as they traveled south.                                    The Canary Islands were the last stop before an                             expedition set off on the journey across the Atlantic Ocean.                            This was the last dry land the Conquistadors would see for                                                               4","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 months.  It was a chance for them to fill their storage                               compartments with fresh water, citrus fruits, and other                               supplies.                                      Later that day, after the ships were docked, Alvar went                               to lunch with Alonso Castillo, one of the captains of the five                              ships.  This was the first chance that the two men had had to                               sit down and talk.  Together, they enjoyed a meal of fresh                               peaches and bananas.                                      “So, Señor Cabeza de Vaca, are you excited about                               going to the New World?” asked Captain Castillo.                                     “Of course.  Who wouldn’t be?  And please, you may                               call me Alvar.”                                      “And you may call me Alonso,” the captain said.  “I                               hope our voyage is as successful as that of Hernan Cortes.”                                      “Cortes…” Alvar said, wiping peach juice from his                              beard.  “That is a name you must use with caution when                               Governor Narvaez is around.”                                      “What do you mean?” asked Alonso.  Hernan Cortes                               was a hero to every Spaniard.  Just a few years before, Cortes                               had swept through Mexico, conquered the ancient Aztec city                                                                   5","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               of Tenochtitlan, and filled Spain’s treasury with gold.  His                             achievements made him a living legend.                                    “While Cortes was setting up his government in                             Mexico,” Alvar explained, “some of the other                             Conquistadors—and even the king—began to wonder whether                            Cortes was getting a little too hungry for power.  Cortes’                             former commander in Cuba sent a small army to put Cortes in                             his place, and to remind him that King Charles was still in                             charge.”                                    Captain Castillo nodded.  He had heard rumors about                            this, but Cortes was so popular that most Spaniards did not                             pay attention to any negative stories about him.                                    “But did you know,” Alvar continued, “that our own                             Governor Narvaez led that army to overthrow Cortes?  When                             Narvaez arrived in Mexico, however, Cortes stole into his                            camp at night with a small group of his own men, captured                             Narvaez, and convinced Narvaez’s army to join him instead.                             Our good governor was sent back to Cuba, and eventually to                             Spain, with his tail between his legs like a scared dog.”                                                                    6","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        Captain Castillo was very surprised.  “I wonder why I                               never heard about this.”                                      “It is not something that the governor likes to talk                               about,” said Alvar.  “It damaged the governor’s reputation,                               and because of this, he had trouble raising money for our                              expedition.  In fact, almost all of the money for these ships                               and supplies came out of Narvaez’s own pocket.  He has his                               entire life’s savings invested in this journey.”                                      “Well, once we arrive in Florida, Governor Narvaez’s                               reputation will be fixed.  I have heard that the treasure in                              Florida is ten times greater than all of the gold in Mexico.”                                      “This may be true,” Alvar warned.  “But we should                               hope that the governor’s desire to outdo Cortes does not hurt                               his judgment.  After all, we are going somewhere that no                               Spaniard has ever been.  There is no way of knowing what                              danger awaits us in Florida.”                                      “You are right to be careful, Alvar, but it is bad luck to                               question our leader at the beginning of the expedition.  We                               should believe in his judgment,” Castillo said, passing a plate                               of honey-covered bananas.                                                                   7","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      “I do hope they load the cargo bay with some of these                             bananas,” Alvar said, changing the subject.  “It will be a long                             time before we see fresh fruit again.”                                    “Just to be sure, I am going to buy a crate of them for                             myself.”                                                       *      *      *                                       Alvar stood on the deck of the ship watching the sunset                             with Governor Narvaez.  It was the middle of August 1527,                             and more than two months had passed since they left the                            Canary Islands.  The voyage across the Atlantic was taking                             longer than expected because of light winds and bad weather.                             Supplies were beginning to run low.                                    “The men will be much happier when we reach                             Hispañola, Governor,” said Alvar.  “Once they have rested on                            land for a while, they will be more excited about continuing                             on to Florida.”                                    “If only the wind would cooperate as it did the last time                             I made this trip,” said Narvaez, staring at the horizon.  “But I                                                                8","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 can wait.  The more we suffer now, the greater our rewards                               will be when we finally reach Florida.”                                      Then the governor grasped Alvar’s shoulder, and began                               laughing.  “My loyal friend, Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca,”                               he chuckled, “How did you get a name that means ‘Cow’s                              Head’?”                                      The governor’s remark did not anger Alvar.  From the                               time he was a boy, dreaming of sailing the high seas, his                               classmates were making fun of his name.  “Actually,                               Governor,” Alvar said proudly, “the name was given to my                              family by the king after the Battle of Toledo.  Because of—”                                      “Ah, the great battle on the plains of Toledo,” the                               governor interrupted.  “My ancestors fought there as well.                               Because of that victory two hundred and fifty years ago, we                               are no longer slaves to the Moors!  But why would a king give                              such a funny name to your family?”                                      “A shepherd on my mother’s side of the family knew                               of an unguarded pass through the mountains,” Alvar                               continued after the governor was finished interrupting.  “The                               armies of the kings used this path to launch a surprise attack                              on the Moors.   He marked the path with a cow’s skull.                                                                 9","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               Without this shepherd’s help, the Spanish never would have                             won.”                                    “Is that so?” the governor responded, but Alvar was not                             sure that Narvaez had really been listening.  “Look at the                             golden sunset.  That is what awaits us, Cabeza de Vaca... more                            gold than the light of the sun itself.  Years from now, your                             great-grandchildren will be called ‘Cabeza de Oro,’ – ‘Head                             of Gold’ - in your honor,” Narvaez laughed.  “Cortes himself                             will be begging at our door when he hears of our treasure and                             the land we have conquered.”                                   “Yes, but there is a lot of work to be done before we                             can boast,” said Alvar.                                    “Of course,” agreed Narvaez.  “We must get supplies                             and horses in Hispañola.  Then we must build a settlement in                             Florida.  But I do not think of it as work, Cabeza de Vaca.  I                            see it as adventure, and soon we will have a new land in the                             name of good King Charles.”                                    “Long live the king, and Spain’s glory!” said Alvar, as                             the sun disappeared below the sea.                                    During the sea voyage, they ran low on food, they were                            always tired, and usually sick.  Plus, the sailors were often                                                               10","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 bored.  If there was no wind, then there was nothing for them                               to do but scrub the decks, play dominoes, and polish their                               swords.  They tried to ignore their thirst and the hot sun.  Even                               the most experienced sailors were worn out after a month.  By                               the end of the second month, many of them were feeling                              cramped and crazy.  A sailor had to look at the same faces on                               the ship every day.  He got tired of hearing the same old war                               stories and complaints about hunger and thirst.                                      To make himself feel better, Alvar thought about his                               grandfather and all the other Conquistadors who had claimed                              so much land and gold for Spain.  Columbus was the first to                               cross from mainland Europe to the Americas.  A few years                               later, Ferdinand Magellan proved that the world was round                               because the great oceans were all connected.  Hernan Cortes                               and many others soon followed.  They began carving up the                              New World as if it were a roasted turkey.  These explorers and                               Conquistadors had all suffered during their voyages across the                               Atlantic, just like Alvar and the rest of his expedition.                                      But soon the journey would be over.  ‘I can make it                               through this,’ Alvar thought to himself.  ‘If they could do it,                              then so can I.  Like Governor Narvaez said, the more we                                                                11","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               suffer now, the greater our rewards will be in Florida.  We                             will build a rich colony and explore new land.’                                    After these happy thoughts, Alvar fell asleep and rested                             better than he had in months.                                    In the morning, Alvar was suddenly awakened by the                            sounds of shouting and the stamping of feet on the decks                             above.  He dressed quickly and ran to see what the excitement                             was all about.                                    On deck, the whole crew was gathered, waving flags                             and shouting out to the other four ships of the expedition.                            Way up high on the tallest mast, he saw the lookout, named                             Lope de Oviedo, pointing west and laughing with joy.                             Straining his eyes, Alvar was able to make out a distant                             landmass, rising from the sea like a thin haze.                                    “Do you think it is Hispañola, Governor?” Alvar asked.                                   “No doubt about it,” replied Governor Narvaez.  “It is                             just as I remember it on my first journey to the New World.”                                                      *      *      *                                      Santo Domingo, on the island of Hispañola, was the                            first European settlement in the New World.  When Alvar                                                               12","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 arrived, thirty-five years after its founding, it was the center of                               shipping and trade.  Alvar heard the deep ringing of the bells                               in the small cathedral as he and the officers of the expedition                               walked down the gangplank and into the thriving town.                               Christopher Columbus’ body was buried in that cathedral, and                              it was the first place the expedition visited when they set foot                               on land.                                      In Santo Domingo, the Narvaez expedition replenished                               its supplies and recovered their health after the long, difficult                               sea voyage.  The crews were eager to explore the port and                              meet some new people.  In this town there were sailors,                               soldiers, traders, slaves, former slaves, and Native Americans                               from many places.  All had come to Santo Domingo for                               different reasons—some to become rich, some in order to                               escape another place, some because they had nowhere else to                              go.                                      During the day, the center of the town was a lively                               marketplace.  Fruits, vegetables, weapons, furs, jewelry,                               livestock, sugar, spices, rum, and horses: everything could be                               found in Santo Domingo.  At night, the people held lively                              feasts and dances, especially when a new expedition came to                                                                13","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               town.  Governor Narvaez did not spend much time feasting,                             however.                                    “There is too much to do,” the governor said.  “Cabeza                             de Vaca, go and find Captain Castillo.  The three of us will                             start by shopping for horses.”                                   “I will be happy to, sir,” Alvar replied.  He loved                             horses, and had been looking forward to a nice, relaxing                             horseback ride for months.                                    Horses were vital for many reasons.  No expedition                             into the unknown territories of the New World could succeed                            without them.  They were used to haul supplies across rivers                             and up steep mountains. More importantly, a horse’s speed,                             strength and size would give the Conquistadors a big                             advantage if they got into a fight with natives, because the                             natives did not have horses.  Good horses were very                            expensive, and so Narvaez chose carefully.  They visited                             every trader in the area, and Narvaez personally rode and                             approved each horse before he paid for it.                                    After a few days of horse shopping, Narvaez decided to                             buy some new weapons.  Alvar followed him to the workshop                                                                 14","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 of a gunsmith who was completing a dozen new muskets for                               Narvaez.                                      “This is a fine piece,” Narvaez said as he raised one of                               the muskets to his shoulder.  “Will they be finished soon?”                                      “Within a week, señor,” replied the gunsmith.                                     “Good,” Narvaez said merrily.  “I like your work.                               These guns are beautiful, but I hope they also shoot straight.”                                      “You have my guarantee, señor.”                                      The stock of each musket was specially engraved and                               covered in hints of gold, silver, and mother of pearl.  Narvaez                              handed a musket to Alvar.  It was as heavy as a large bucket                               of water and nearly as tall as he was.  He ran his finger down                               the smooth, polished barrel, admiring its craftsmanship.                               These were called wheel-lock muskets.  To fire it, a soldier                               first had to light the fuse, which was connected to a wheel.                              When the trigger was pulled, the wheel spun and the fuse                               ignited a pan of gunpowder, which fired the bullet.  Most                               Conquistadors carried crossbows, because at that time                               muskets were as expensive as horses.  It was still important to                               have a few guns, however, simply because the noise they                              made struck fear into the natives.                                                                15","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      Narvaez also bought a sixth ship, which was very                             expensive but necessary, because he planned to expand his                             crew and take along enough supplies to build a fort when they                             reached the mainland.  This ship was also smaller and faster                             than the others, and would be better for exploring shallow                            rivers and bays.  All the ships were loaded with dried meats,                             salted fish, flour, tools, lumber, horses, oxen, water, and rope.                             Narvaez even bought a huge bronze bell to put on top of the                             church he planned to build.  Alvar watched twenty men and                             four oxen struggling to put the bell into the ship’s cargo hold.                            ‘How will we ever hoist something that big and heavy into a                             church tower?’ he wondered.                                    Narvaez and his officers gathered information                             wherever they went, asking all the locals what they knew of                             the land and natives in Florida.  Unfortunately, little was                            known at the time.                                    “What about the City of Gold?” Narvaez asked a                             blacksmith.                                    “I have not heard of a city made of gold, though I am                             sure that if such a thing exists—”                                                                 16","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        “What do you mean if it exists, man?” Narvaez                               interrupted, grabbing the blacksmith by the collar.  “Of course                               it exists!”                                      “Yes sir,” the blacksmith said nervously, “What I                               meant to say was that wherever the City of Gold is, I am sure                              your mighty expedition will find it.”                                      “And what about the Fountain of Youth that will make                               you young forever if you drink its water?” the governor asked                               a fur trader.  “Have you heard from any of the Indians about                               the Fountain of Youth?”                                     The fur trader grinned.  “You’ll be lucky to find any                               water at all where you are going.  I have heard that the rivers                               are all dried up.”                                      “What is wrong with these people?” Narvaez asked                               Alvar.  “Why do they have nothing but bad news?”                                     “They are only simple men, who care about nothing but                               making a living,” Alvar assured the governor.  “They do not                               share our dreams.”                                      “I suppose that is true,” Narvaez said.  “But soon we                               will prove that they are all wrong.  We will find the City of                                                                  17","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               Gold and the Fountain of Youth, and they will all feel                             foolish.”                                    After a month in Santo Domingo, many of the men                             were bored and ready to move on to greater adventures.                             Others, however, listened with fear to the stories they heard                            from the locals about the tribes of cannibals, deserts, savage                             beasts, and hurricanes that were waiting for them in Florida.                             After hearing these stories, some men decided it would be                             better either to return to Spain, or to seek their fortunes as                             traders or farmers on Hispañola.  By the time Narvaez ordered                            the ships to set sail for Florida, one hundred and forty men                             had deserted the expedition.                                    “Unfortunately, Governor, many of the men have heard                             bad rumors,” explained Captain Alonso Castillo.                                    “The deserters are all cowards, and it is better that we                            know this now than after we reach Florida,” replied Governor                             Narvaez.  All the officers nodded in agreement.  “I only wish                             that they had never come along at all.  We will find new                             crewmen in Cuba.”                                                          *      *      *                                                                 18","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        On the way to Florida, the Narvaez expedition made                               several stops on the island of Cuba.  Governor Narvaez met a                               rich man named Vasco Porcallo, who owned warehouses full                               of food and other supplies in the small town of Trinidad.                               These he offered to the expedition in return for some of the                              gold that Narvaez promised they would find.  On the way to                               Trinidad, they pulled into a small port in the Bay of Santa                               Cruz to find fresh fruit and water.  As they loaded their empty                               water barrels, Narvaez talked to a local fisherman named                               Miruelo.                                     “I hear you are going to Florida,” Miruelo said.  “What                               do you know about the waters there?”                                      “Only what I have heard from sailors on Hispañola.”                                      “Well, anyone in Cuba will tell you that I know these                               waters like the back of my hand.”                                     “Have you been to Florida?” asked Narvaez.                                      “Not on the land itself, but I sailed my fishing boat to                               the north-west and along the coast of Florida for many days,                               until I ran out of food and water,” Miruelo explained.                                      “What did you find?” Captain Castillo asked eagerly.                              “Are there good harbors for the ships?”                                                                19","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      “Could you see the land?” asked Alvar, overhearing the                             conversation.                                    “Slow down, gentlemen,” Miruelo smiled. “I will be                             glad to answer all of your questions.  But first, what is the pay                             for a navigator on your expedition?”                                   “I promise, Miruelo, that you will be a rich man if your                             information is correct,” said Narvaez.  “We will discuss your                             ideas further after we finish our business at Trinidad.”                                    “Trinidad?  Why are you going to Trinidad?”                                    “To pick up supplies from Vasco Porcallo’s                            warehouses.”                                    “But there is no harbor at Trinidad, at least not one for                             ships as large as yours,” Miruelo laughed.  “You should sail                             for Florida as soon as possible before the weather changes.                             Don’t waste time in Trinidad.”                                   “The first thing you must understand if you want to                             help pilot my ships is that I make the decisions.  Is that clear?”                             said Narvaez.                                    “Of course.”                                    “Good, then your first job will be to guide Captain                            Pantoja’s ship to Trinidad and gather our supplies.  There is                                                               20","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 no reason to send all the ships, especially if there is no harbor                               there,” said Narvaez.                                      Alvar was made captain of the small ship Narvaez                               bought in Hispañola.  He followed Pantoja and Miruelo to                               Trinidad.  When they arrived the next day, Captain Pantoja                              took thirty men and rowed ashore to meet Vasco Porcallo’s                               cousin, who had the key to the warehouse.                                      “You must hurry, Captain Pantoja,” Miruelo called                               from the ship. “This is a dangerous bay.  Many ships have                               been lost here.”                                     Soon afterwards, huge storm clouds began to darken                               the sky.  The wind blew furiously, rain began to pour, and the                               sea began to churn.  The ships rocked from side to side and                               the sailors were forced to pull up the anchors.  They could not                               use the sails and search for a safer harbor because the wind                              was too strong; so they gritted their teeth and hoped that the                               waves would not send them crashing against the rugged coast                               or off into uncharted seas.                                      Despite the horrible weather, two men managed to                               paddle a canoe across the bay to Alvar’s ship with an                              invitation to come ashore.  The residents of Trinidad, many of                                                                21","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               them wealthy plantation owners, were excited by the news of                             a new expedition.  Like Vasco Porcallo, they hoped to gain a                             share of the profits by offering their goods and services.                                    “Señor Cabeza de Vaca,” one of the men shouted as a                             wave drenched the canoe, “the master of the plantation insists                            that you come out of this awful weather and join him for                             dinner.”                                    “Tell him ‘thank you,’ but that I am used to bad                             weather.  Besides, I am responsible for these ships and                             crews.”                                   “Please, señor, we have a horse for you on shore.  You                             will be quite pleased with the supplies we have to offer.”                                    Alvar could see that the men in the canoe were not                             going to give up, so he decided to go along with them.  Alvar                             invited the other men on the ship, but they all said ‘no,’ except                            Miruelo.                                    “Trust me, you should come ashore,” Miruelo told the                             other crewmen, “You do not understand how dangerous these                             storms can be.”                                    “We are sons of Spain, Miruelo.  We are not afraid of a                            little rain,” the crew said, and returned below decks.                                                               22","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        On the shore, Alvar struggled to control his horse as                               broken trees fell in their path and thunder split the air.  The                               first thing Alvar saw when they finally reached Trinidad was                               the roof of a house tumbling end over end across the village’s                               square.  He stared, frozen with fear, as the roof was slammed                              to the ground by a big gust of wind.  A long wood splinter                               from the roof cut into his shoulder.  Then a giant roof-beam                               the length of two horses nearly crushed him as it bounced past                               end over end.  Alvar’s horse tossed him into a mud puddle and                               ran into the jungle.  The men who were with him locked their                              arms with his to avoid being blown away as they searched for                               shelter, blinded by the wind and rain.                                      The storm was so violent that it knocked down all the                               houses in Trinidad.  Alvar and the others ran desperately from                               one building to the next, until all of the people were huddled                              in the church.                                      “Is this what awaits us in Florida?” Captain Pantoja                               called to Alvar.                                      “I do not know,” Alvar said.  “Let us hope that the                               ships and crews are safe.”                                                                  23","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      The next morning, when the storm finally passed,                             Alvar found his horse and rode to shore, fearing the worst.                             His eyes scanned the harbor, but there were no signs of any                             ships.                                    “Maybe they were blown out to sea,” said Captain                            Pantoja.                                    “Maybe,” Alvar said.  The beach and skies were                             perfectly calm.  Alvar watched a seagull gliding along above                             the gentle waves.  As the gull flew higher, Alvar’s attention                             was drawn to a tree on the edge of the beach.  He blinked his                            eyes several times, unable to believe what he saw.  One of the                             lifeboats from the ships was sitting right on top of the tree, as                             though it had fallen from the skies.  He shook his head and                             almost cried as he imagined what it must have been like for                             the men aboard those two ships during their final desperate                            minutes.                                    “I warned your governor that this harbor was not safe,”                             Miruelo said, shaking his head.  “Those ships and crews never                             had a chance.”                                    Alvar said nothing.  He began to notice bits of wood                            and other debris washing in with the surf.  He saw a man’s                                                               24","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 shoe, a broken oar, pieces of sails, and ropes.  Some of the                               men found two bodies that had washed ashore, but they were                               so bruised and beaten by the rocks that nobody recognized                               their faces.                                      Along with the loss of fifty men and two ships, Vasco                              Porcallo’s warehouses had been destroyed, and so the                               expedition lost a lot of supplies.  After the terrible loss,                               Narvaez decided it was best to stay in Cuba for the winter, and                               continue on to Florida in early springtime.                                      “Cabeza de Vaca, do you remember what I said                              before?” the governor asked.                                      “Yes,” Alvar said, trying not to sound as sad as he felt.                               “The more we suffer now, the greater our rewards will be                               when we finally reach Florida.”                                                        *       *      *                                                                              25","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      On February 20, 1528, Governor Narvaez gathered his                             men.  Everyone felt good after relaxing for three months.  The                             wealthy people of Santiago de Cuba felt sorry for the                             Conquistadors because of all they had lost, so they loaned                             Narvaez a new ship and fifty soldiers.  With Miruelo steering                            Governor Narvaez’s flagship, the expedition set sail for the                             coast of Florida.  There were four hundred and fifty men and                             eighty horses aboard five ships.                                    The expedition had smooth sailing the first day, but on                             the morning of the second day, Alvar suddenly saw the ship                            ahead of his grinding to almost a complete stop with wind still                             filling the sails.  Before his boat could turn, Alvar felt his                             ship’s keel drag across sand.  Soon, all five ships were stuck                             because they had sailed onto sandbars, or shoals as the sailors                             called them.                                   “I thought you knew these waters, Miruelo,” the                             governor said angrily.                                    “Are you saying that this is all my fault?” Miruelo                             asked.                                    “Who else could possibly be at fault?” Governor                            Narvaez shouted.                                                               26","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        “I told you, I sailed to Florida on a small fishing boat,                               not a loaded cargo ship.  I passed over these shoals without                               any problems.  How could I know they were here?”                                      “How long will we be stuck here?” Alvar asked,                               knowing that blaming Miruelo would not do them any good.                                     “Who knows?” replied Miruelo.  “The tides are                               unpredictable this time of year.  Within a day or two, though, I                               think we will be washed out of the shoals and on our way to                               Florida.”                                      By the end of the first week, many of the men were                              beginning to think they were doomed to starve on those                               shoals.  Day after day they waited on the motionless ships, all                               the time being teased by the wind as it blew towards Florida.                               At last, a great storm came from the south, bringing with it                               enough wind and water to lift all the ships off the shoals.                              Once the ships were free, however, they were shaken and                               battered by the storm’s twelve-foot waves.                                      The next day, another storm struck before they had                               finished fixing the damage caused by the first.  After the                               second, a third and even stronger storm stirred the sea.  Every                              man aboard the ships huddled together below decks and                                                                27","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               prayed after each furious wave.  Several times the ship                             swayed so much that it was forced on its side.  Barrels of flour                             and water came loose and broke open, and the men were                             tossed around like dolls.                                    To make everything worse, the horses became sick and                            half of them died.  This made everyone very sad.  “What a                             waste,” was all anyone could say each time they heaved one                             of the once strong and beautiful creatures into the sea.                                    Finally, in early April, after barely surviving another                             hurricane, the five ships came within sight of Florida’s                            beaches.  Alvar joined the governor and other officers aboard                             the flagship.                                    “Look at the beach, Cabeza de Vaca,” Narvaez said,                             pointing to three small grass huts. “Do you see them?”                                    “Yes, yes I do.  What do we do now, Governor?”                                   “I will claim this land in the name of King Charles.                             This should make a strong impression on the Indians.  When                             they see our horses, guns, and the colors of His Majesty’s                             flags, they will know that we are the true masters of this land.”                                    “Forgive me, Governor, but we know nothing about the                            natives…”                                                               28","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        “We know they are savages!” Narvaez interrupted.                               “They live in grass huts.  They probably eat insects, if not one                               another.  Are you afraid, Cabeza de Vaca, that we                               Conquistadors cannot overpower them?”                                      “No sir, I have no fear,” Alvar said confidently.                              Indeed, Alvar believed he and his friends were stronger than                               whoever lived in those huts on the beach.  He simply thought                               it was safer and wiser to gather more information before they                               charged ahead.                                                        *       *      *                                        Governor Narvaez left the ships anchored at sea and                               rowed with three hundred men toward the beach with the three                               huts.  They fired several musket shots to announce their                              arrival, and then re-lit the fuses in case the natives decided to                               attack.  But there were no people there.                                      “Governor, sir, I found a trail with many footprints                               leading into the jungle.  There must be a larger village                               nearby,” said one of the Conquistadors, named Enriquez.  He                              was a scout, whose job it was to travel ahead and guide the                                                                29","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               main army.  Enriquez was also the expedition’s official                             interpreter.  Whenever they did meet the natives, he would be                             the one who tried to communicate with them.                                    “Then we will follow that trail,” Narvaez ordered.                             “There is nothing for us here on the beach.  Stay close to me,                            Enriquez.  Savages could be anywhere.  They must have run                             away when they saw us coming.”                                    In the village, they found a couple of dozen empty huts.                             The army checked the ashes in the fire pits to see how long it                             had been since the fires were put out.  The ashes were not                            warm.                                    “It is strange, Governor,” said Enriquez.  “They must                             have fled during the night.”                                    “Maybe they are out gathering food,” suggested                             Captain Castillo.                                   “I doubt they would simply ignore five foreign ships so                             near the beach,” said Alvar.  “As far as we know, they have                             never seen a ship or a Spaniard, at least not one that has lived                             to tell about it.”                                                                    30","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        Governor Narvaez thought for a moment, and then                               said: “I hereby claim this village and the surrounding land in                               the name of His Majesty, King Charles the Fifth.”                                      When the governor finished speaking, the village was                               totally quiet.  Alvar heard the hiss of the musket fuses, which                              were now burning almost to the end.  A mosquito buzzed in                               his ear and he slapped at it, but missed.  Several other slaps                               could be heard against faces and arms as insects of all kinds                               swarmed to the sweaty army.                                      This was not what Alvar or anyone else had expected.                              It was so hot and humid that his sweat seemed to seep through                               the armor that covered his head and chest.  It was not long                               before every man felt as though he was being watched.                               Alvar’s horse, among the healthiest of the forty that remained,                               became very restless.   Fear increased each time a branch                              moved or a bird flapped its wings.                                      Narvaez looked impatiently at his nervous army.                               “Extinguish the musket fuses and raise His Majesty’s                               banners!” he commanded.                                      “Now what do we do?” asked Alvar after the flags                              were planted in the ground.                                                                31","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      “We will prepare to march inland and find a better                             place to build our settlement.  Send for Miruelo the pilot.”                                    Miruelo came ashore along with food, barrels of water,                             the rest of the horses, and other supplies.  Everyone knew,                             however, that these supplies would not last long as they                            moved inland.  Alvar picked ten soldiers to escort him while                             he and Enriquez explored the area around the village to see if                             there was any fresh food or water nearby.  His horse found                             some grass that it liked, but other than that, there was nothing                             edible, at least nothing that Alvar recognized.  He wanted to                            explore further, but the soldiers were nervous and begged him                             to wait.                                    “I don’t understand how anyone can survive here, sir,”                             Alvar reported to the governor.  “My horse will not even drink                             from this swamp.”                                   “Miruelo, have you worked out where there is a safe                             harbor for the ships?” Narvaez asked.  “I can’t just march                             inland and leave them out in that dangerous bay.”                                    “To be honest, sir, I am not exactly sure where we are.                             The storm took us far off course.”                                                                 32","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        “Why did you brag so much when I hired you, and now                               you don’t even know where we are?”                                      “We might have missed the harbor, sir—”                                      “I don’t want to hear ‘might’ right now, Miruelo.  I am                               giving you an order.  Four ships and one hundred men will                              remain at a safe distance from this shore.  You will take the                               fifth ship with a crew of fifty and sail down the coast to find                               the harbor.  If you cannot find it within two months, then                               come back and meet us here.”                                      “Forgive me, Governor Narvaez, but your four ships                              will not last two months in these waters, especially not the one                               with the giant bronze bell in its cargo hold,” Miruelo said.                               Alvar expected the governor to strike the cowardly pilot or run                               him through with his sword.                                      “That is all the more reason to find the harbor as soon                              as possible,” said Narvaez, trying to stay calm.  “Either way, I                               will see you here in two months.”                                                         *       *      *                                                                    33","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      The men were too nervous to sleep that first night in                             Florida.  They re-sharpened their swords, groomed the horses,                             double-checked their food supplies and played dominoes.                             Narvaez stayed by himself all night, refusing to be disturbed.                             In the morning he called a meeting to explain the plan for the                            day.  As he spoke, several natives appeared at the edge of the                             village.                                    “Look, Governor,” exclaimed a startled soldier, “Wild                             Indians!”                                    Alvar was standing with his back to the natives.  When                            he turned to face them, his jaw dropped at the sight of five                             dark-skinned, muscular men.  The skin on their chests and                             stomachs was pierced with shards of bone for decoration.                             They did not have beards.  The glossy, black hair on their                             heads hung past their shoulders, and was streaked with thick,                            red dye.  The Conquistadors immediately re-lit the musket                             fuses, loaded the crossbows, and reached for their swords.                             Seeing this, the five natives raised their bows, each of which                             was almost as long as a man.  They pointed their arrows at the                             entire army to show that they were not afraid.                                                                 34","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        “Stay calm, men!” Narvaez ordered.  “Lower your                               weapons.   These savages cannot hurt us.”                                      Fifty more natives walked from the woods, all armed                               with bows and clubs.  One of the five who first appeared                               started speaking and motioning towards the sea with his arms.                                     “What is he saying, Enriquez?” asked the governor.                                      “Sir, I have never heard a language like that.  Perhaps                               we should offer a trade to show them that we are friendly.”                                      Enriquez withdrew a fine knife with a silver handle and                               offered it to the native.  The man shook his head and motioned                              again towards the sea, pointing at the Conquistadors and                               shaking his arrows.  Then he walked directly into the middle                               of the soldiers, ignoring the swords and guns pointed at him,                               and stood face to face with Narvaez.  The governor stayed still                               as the bold native yelled what sounded like threats and insults                              at the top of his lungs.                                      Narvaez removed a handkerchief from his pocket and                               wiped the native’s spittle from his face.                                      “Well, you have to admire his courage, I suppose,” the                               governor laughed.  “He thinks he can frighten me.  How can I                              be expected to negotiate with this beast?”  Then he turned his                                                                35","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               back to the native.  When he did this, the man lunged at him,                             but four soldiers grabbed the attacker in mid-air and pushed                             him to the ground.                                    “What are your thoughts, Cabeza de Vaca?” the                             governor continued, as though nothing had happened.                                   “He wants us to leave, Governor.”                                    “We will do no such thing.  We outnumber them six to                             one, and are better armed,” the governor said, raising his voice                             so that all could hear.  “Enriquez, show them my gold chain.                             Ask if they know where we can find gold.”                                   Enriquez tried to ask about gold, but before long, all                             the native men simply turned and walked away.  Narvaez and                             his officers gathered to think things over.                                    “We should not wander far until we know the ships are                             in a safe harbor,” said Alvar.                                   “Yes, but the land here is like a desert.  The men need                             water badly,” replied Enriquez.                                    The governor nodded.  “This is true.  The land here is                             not as I was told it would be.  We must march and find land                             better suited for our needs.”                                                                 36","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        “But if we lose the ships, then we will be stuck here.                               Besides, we do not have enough food or horses for a long                               journey inland.  Only six of the horses are healthy enough to                               be of much use.  We have no way to communicate with these                               people.  If we can learn some of their language, then they                              might be able to...”                                      “Cabeza de Vaca, how will we gain anything if we do                               not at least explore?” Captain Castillo asked.                                      “Enough bickering,” said Governor Narvaez.  “We will                               explore inland first, and then walk down the coast and find the                              harbor.  If we get there before Miruelo, then we will send a                               messenger back here to signal the ships.  If you do not want to                               come on the journey, Cabeza de Vaca, you may head back to                               the ships and meet us later.  We have traveled for a year and                               waited all our lives for this moment.  Now you say the time is                              not right.  Are you not a true Conquistador?”                                      Alvar said nothing because he did not want to seem                               like a coward. ‘I suppose I’ll just have to see what happens,’                               he thought.                                      Marching was very difficult in the Florida jungle, with                              its stout palm trees and thick, prickly underbrush.  Every man                                                                37","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               slashed with his sword, trying to clear the path before him.  At                             the same time, the land was dry like a desert, apart from the                             occasional smelly swamp with waist-high black water.  They                             were scared at the sight of their first alligators, though the                             creatures turned out to be harmless and stayed out of the way.                                   Every inch of the land was new and totally strange to                             them.  The number of plants and animals amazed Alvar.                             Nevertheless, he quickly lost interest, for it was not a                             comfortable place.  Each day the temperature rose a few                             degrees higher than the day before.  After a week of marching,                            the heat had become so intense that the men began stumbling                             under the weight of their armor. The armor rubbed against the                             skin on their backs and made a painful rash.  Since the day                             they marched inland from the abandoned village, their diet                             had been limited to small rations of biscuit and salted meat.                            As soldiers, the men were used to being uncomfortable, but                             this did not make their hunger any less painful.                                    They discovered certain plants, which they called                             ‘palmitos’ that were similar to small, cabbage-like plants in                             Spain.  Palmitos tasted bad and they were hard to find, but                            they were the soldiers only other source of food.  They grew                                                               38","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 sick from drinking unclean water and from their countless                               insect bites.  For more than two weeks, they marched and                               found no natives, no villages, no gold—nothing but miserable                               wilderness.                                      “Do not give up, men!  The more we suffer, the greater                              our rewards!” the governor shouted.                                      But Alvar and the others were tired of hearing this.                               What reward could possibly be worth such pain?  All any of                               them wanted to do was to get out of Florida.                                                        *       *      *                                        Alvar heard shouts from farther down the trail, and                               then the thunderous shot of a musket.  By the time he ran to                               see what was the matter, he had to push his way through a                              crowd of excited Conquistadors.  Four young native women                               were sitting on the ground.  They wore deerskin tunics, and                               they were shivering with fear.                                      “They tried to run away from us, Governor, so Pablo                               fired in the air to frighten them,” explained Enriquez.                                                                  39","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      “Well, do your job as interpreter, Enriquez,” said                             Narvaez.  “Find out where they live, so that we can get some                             food.”                                    Enriquez tried to communicate, but the four women did                             not understand.  Seeing this, Alvar had an idea.  He pointed to                            himself and to the other Spaniards, then made a sweeping                             motion in the direction where the sun rises.  He repeated this                             several times to show the women where the Conquistadors                             had come from.  Then he pointed at the women and looked                             around, trying to ask where they were from.  The women                            pointed down the trail, toward the setting sun.  Narvaez                             stepped behind one of the women and poked her with his                             sword in the direction she had motioned.                                    “Careful, Governor, it is best not to frighten them too                             much,” Alvar warned.                                   “I think it is too late for that,” Narvaez replied,                             continuing to poke the woman’s back.                                    The army followed the four captured guides down the                             trail to a small village, which they tore apart looking for food                             and gold.  There were few villagers, and judging by their                            looks, they barely had enough food for themselves.  The                                                               40","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 Conquistadors were happy to find a few baskets of dried                               maize.  There was not much, but it was better than nothing.                                      “Cabeza de Vaca,” the governor said, “you had luck                               using signs with them before.  See if they know where there is                               more maize.  And show them this necklace and ask if they                              know where to find gold.”                                      Alvar scratched a rough map in the earth with a stick.                               Using signs, he asked the villagers what was to the north.  He                               placed some maize and the gold necklace on the ground and                               pointed to them, trying to show what he hoped to find.  The                              villagers talked amongst themselves, and then one man                               stepped forward and said, “Apalachee.”                                      “What did he say?” asked Narvaez eagerly.                                      “I think he means there is a place called Apalachee.”                                      “What is that?” Narvaez grabbed the stick from Alvar                              and handed it to the native.  “Apalachee.  Show me                               Apalachee!” The governor raised his voice when he spoke to                               the native, as though the man could not understand because he                               was deaf.                                      “Apalachee,” the man repeated, pointing to the north.                                                                  41","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      He drew several huts with the stick to show that there                             was a village there.                                    Narvaez responded by throwing more gold and maize                             onto the earth where the man was pointing.  “Apalachee?                             Does Apalachee have maize and gold?” he shouted.  The man                            nodded and made signs that made Narvaez believe that the                             people in Apalachee were rich.                                    “This is what we have been waiting for, men.                             Apalachee might be our Tenochtitlan!” the governor yelled.                                    “You’re still thinking about Cortes after all we’ve been                            through?” The words were out of Alvar’s mouth before he                             knew it.                                    “What do you mean?” the governor snapped.                                    Alvar decided he might as well tell the governor what                             he thought.  “I mean that you speak of Cortes as if you are in                            competition with him.  You have ghosts chasing you,                             Governor Narvaez!  With all due respect, sir, I only hope that                             you are making decisions based on what is best for the                             expedition, not for your reputation.”                                    The governor was outraged by this disrespect.  He                            clenched his jaws and fists, and stood with his face an inch                                                               42","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 from Alvar’s.  “Cabeza de Vaca, this is what is best for the                               expedition.  If the Indians say there is gold and maize in                               Apalachee, then we go.  Let them know that, if they are lying,                               we will return and burn this pathetic village.”                                      “Really, Alvar,” said Alonso Castillo, stepping                              between the two men.  “This is the first good news we have                               had in weeks.  Governor Narvaez, Cabeza de Vaca meant no                               disrespect, for he is tired and must have lost his mind for a                               moment.”                                      They packed all the maize they could find onto the                              horses, as well as some dried meat they found in one of the                               huts.  To make sure the women were not lying, Narvaez took                               two women hostage to serve as guides.                                                         *       *      *                                       The three hundred men, who grew weaker and weaker,                               wandered for another month in the sweltering heat.  Before                               long, they had eaten all the food and had drunk all of the clean                               water.  At times, Alvar would forget he was walking, as                              though he had simply floated away from his body.  He would                                                                43","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               think of nothing during these spells—not the hunger, thirst,                             heat, or the weight of the armor.  Everything was a dark                             tunnel.  When he snapped back into reality, sometimes he                             would realize that hours had passed, and he could remember                             nothing that he had done or seen.  Occasionally, he heard the                            governor say something about ‘suffering’ and ‘great rewards.’                                    ‘Is this what it was like for my grandfather?’ Alvar                             wondered. ‘And Cortes, did he have so much trouble?’                                    At last, the landscape began to change.  Alvar was                             thankful to see laurel trees in full blossom, because he had                            forgotten about spring during their march through the swamps                             and deserts.  Oak trees towered overhead.  Grand pine trees                             and fragrant cedars were everywhere.  The bushes and                             underbrush were softer and greener than the horrible thorns                             farther south.  Even better, certain plants and mushrooms were                            edible.                                    The bark of some trees was stripped where bears had                             sharpened their claws and deer their antlers.  Fresh rabbit                             tracks spotted the forest floor, giving the men hope of meat                             stew for dinner.  One of the scouts even spotted a panther with                            a coat the color of the night sky, but he missed when he tried                                                               44","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 to shoot it.  There were more birds than Alvar ever imagined                               possible.  He recognized geese, ducks, herons, falcons,                               sparrowhawks, and partridges.                                      Low hills sprang up in the landscape, providing relief                               from the flatness of lower-Florida.  They were also happy to                              see cool fresh lakes filled with frogs and fish.  The expedition                               stopped at one lake and every man immediately stripped his                               clothing and jumped in for a much-needed bath.  Alvar                               scrubbed the dust from his horse, which was now the strongest                               on the expedition.                                     “I took some men ahead to scout, sir,” Enriquez                               reported to the governor, who was swimming.  “There is a                               mighty river beyond that hill.  I think you should have a look.”                                      “Very well,” said the governor, “but can it not wait                               until morning?”                                     They headed for the river early the next morning, well                               rested after a good night’s sleep and a meal of wild game.  But                               when they arrived at the river, Alvar’s hope faded.  It was as                               swift and wide as any they had ever seen.                                      “Enriquez, you take a scouting party that way.  Cabeza                              de Vaca, you go that way.  We must find a better place to                                                                45","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               cross,” ordered the governor.  Both parties walked for the                             better part of the day, and returned in the late afternoon                             without good news.                                    “There might be a place many miles down river which                             is better,” Alvar reported, “but it will take three hundred men                            two days to get there.”                                    While the officers discussed the plan, one of the                             soldiers, a brave young cavalryman named Juan Valasquez                            grew very impatient.  “Enough stalling! We have a city to                             conquer!” he yelled, and the others watched as he rode his                             horse into the river.  He did not make it very far before he was                            swept away by the current and quickly drowned under the                             weight of his armor and his panicked horse.  He was the first                             man to die since landing in Florida.  After retrieving his body                            they gave him a formal burial.  By then it was dark and,                             having been without food all day, some of the men decided to                             eat Valasquez’s horse, for it too had drowned.  Alvar was very                            sad as he watched them roast the noble animal, and he went to                             sleep without a meal.                                                         *      *      *                                                                    46","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        Apalachee was not the grand city they had hoped for.                               When they arrived they found only women and children.  The                               Conquistadors forced them into a close circle in the center of                               the village and Narvaez raised the tattered Spanish flags.  He                               then ordered the soldiers to search the huts.  They were happy                              to find a good amount of maize.  They also found many                               trinkets and tools, but not a hint of gold.                                      “Search again!” Narvaez commanded.  “These people                               must have more than beads and rocks.”                                      A little while later, a few of the men of Apalachee                              appeared.  Over the weeks, Alvar had learned some native                               words from the captive guides, and he had also worked out                               many useful hand signals.  Alvar was the only one on the                               expedition who was willing and able to learn the language, so                               he had taken Enriquez’s place as interpreter.                                     “They ask that you allow the women and children to                               leave,” Alvar said.                                      “I don’t see why not, they are no good to us,” replied                               the governor.  “But they must understand that we have made a                               claim on this land, and that they are all subjects of King                              Charles now.”                                                                47","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      “I will do my best to make them understand,” said                             Alvar.  The natives were stone faced while Alvar tried to                             explain the governor’s words.  They were not scared or angry,                             but simply waited for Alvar to finish and then returned to the                             forest with their families.                                   “We should not have done that,” warned Castillo.  “If                             they decide to attack us now, they won’t have to worry about                             hitting their wives and children.”                                    “Well, you should have raised this point earlier if you                             are afraid, Captain Castillo,” said the governor.                                   “I am not afraid.  I am only saying that we should                             prepare to defend ourselves.”                                    The natives attacked an hour later, while Narvaez was                             still busy organizing his soldiers.  The native warriors were                             not frightened away by the gunshots.  They attacked so                            quickly that Alvar was forced to jump and hide behind a tree.                                    An arrow suddenly came straight through the center of                             the tree trunk where he hid.  Its stone tip jutted clean through                             the bark a finger’s length from Alvar’s neck.  To his right, he                             saw the governor and other men running from a flaming hut.                                                                 48","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 The Conquistadors were lucky, however, because the natives                               retreated as quickly as they had attacked.                                      The strength and size of the native warriors surprised                               Alvar.  Their bows were as thick as a man’s arm, and they                               delivered their arrows with amazing accuracy from nearly a                              hundred meters.  Their speed made them very difficult targets,                               for they appeared to be dancing as they fought—always                               moving and hopping from side to side.                                      The Conquistadors soon realized that their guns were                               useless.  Even their crossbows were of little use, because they                              were quite heavy and also required more time to reload than                               native bows.  The natives could fire three times as quickly as                               the soldiers could.  Day after day, the natives continued to                               attack.  They came quickly and quietly, shot a few arrows,                               shouted some insults, and then fled.  After two weeks, many                              of the Conquistadors were wounded and dying.                                      “There is no more food here,” the governor announced                               sadly in a meeting one day.  “Nor is there gold, and I do not                               feel we are making any progress in this so-called war with the                               savages.  Our only choice is to return to the coast.  Maybe we                              will find another village along the way.”                                                                49","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      Two days later, as the Conquistadors were wading                             across a wide and shallow lake, they were attacked again.  The                             natives waited until all of the soldiers were in the water, where                             they were easy targets.  Enriquez was the first to be hit, as an                             arrow passed straight through his chest armor.  Several others                            were hit, many in the arms and shoulders.  The Conquistadors                             could not see their enemies, and wasted their crossbow bolts                             firing blindly into the woods as they struggled to reach the                             shore.  There was no musket fire, for they had not lit the fuses                             before crossing the lake, and now the splashing water made it                            impossible to strike a match.                                    “Cavalry charge, full attack!” yelled Governor                             Narvaez, waving his sword and jamming his spurs in his                             horse’s side.  Though weak, the expedition’s thirty remaining                             horses gave them the advantage they needed to get safely out                            of the water.  Alvar and his horse were the first to reach the                             shore.  He jumped over a bush and saw a native warrior                             scurrying to avoid the horse’s hooves.  Alvar raised his sword                             above the native, and could have killed him, but did not.                             Instead, he froze and watched the surprised native take a few                            steps backwards, and then run away.                                                               50","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        “That native did not look like the others we have seen,”                               Alvar told the governor when the battle was over.                                      “So what?” said Governor Narvaez.  “A savage is a                               savage.  They are all the same to me.”                                      “Yes, but if they attack us before they even meet us, it                              might mean that the tribes are communicating, and telling                               each other that we have come to take their homes.”                                      “Are you saying that the savages are teaming up                               against us?” Narvaez laughed.  “Don’t be foolish.  They are                               only animals.  They attacked because it is all they know how                              to do.”                                      Alvar was not convinced by the governor’s response.                               He looked around at the other tired, depressed Conquistadors.                               After seeing how easily the arrow passed through Enriquez’s                               chest armor, many of them decided to take theirs off, which                              was a great relief to their sore backs.                                      “Maybe now we will be able to run away faster next                               time they attack,” one of them said.                                                         *       *      *                                                                 51","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      The next day, they were attacked again just outside a                             village that their guides told them was called Aute, and which                             they thought would be friendly.  Juan Suarez was shot and                             killed instantly before the natives disappeared into the woods.                             After burying the fallen man, Alvar and Alonso Castillo went                            into the village, only to find that it had been abandoned and                             burned.                                    “Cabeza de Vaca,” the governor said as he slumped                             forward on his horse, completely discouraged, “there is some                             food here that the savages did not burn.  Take it, and fifty of                            the strongest men, and go find the sea.  This land was not                             meant to be conquered.”                                    Alvar left the governor and the rest of the expedition                             and walked for a week, until he finally came to a large body of                             water.  He did not recognize anything, and did not know if it                            was the Atlantic Ocean or not.  By the time he returned to                             camp, his comrades were so sick they could barely move.                                    “We were attacked every day while you were gone,                             Alvar,” the governor said, almost in tears.  “We have no                             ammunition left.  We have no food.  My men are dying.                            Please, Cabeza de Vaca, tell me some good news.”                                                               52","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        “I found a sea, Governor,” Alvar said, trying to sound                               positive.  “There are no signs of the ships, but maybe we can                               flag down a fisherman.”                                      “Maybe the ships returned to Cuba, and they will send                               out search parties soon,” said Captain Castillo.                                     “Yes, maybe.  Either way, it would be a miracle if we                               were found,” said Narvaez.                                      “I can’t believe what I am hearing!” yelled a man who                               until now had been very quiet.  “My name is Don Theodoro.  I                               am a carpenter from Greece.  I planned to use my skills to                              build our new settlement, but it looks like I’ll be building                               boats instead.”                                      “Boats?  Are you crazy, man?” said the governor.  “We                               have no tools. How will we build enough boats for nearly                               three hundred men, especially when most of us are sick?”                                     “We do have tools, sir,” said Carlos Blanco, the                               expedition’s blacksmith.  “We can heat the crossbows, guns,                               and horse stirrups and re-shape them.”                                      “That’s crazy!” said Narvaez.                                                                     53","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      “Not really, sir.  These things are useless to us now.                             We have no ammunition, and the horses are too weak to be                             ridden.”                                    “It may be our only chance, Governor,” said Alvar.  “I,                             for one, would rather try than just wait on the beach for a                            search party that will never come.”                                    “And it’s better than marching through this                             wilderness,” agreed Captain Castillo.                                    Building boats required creativity and hard work.                             Carlos Blanco was able to make axes, saws, hammers, and                            nails from the weapons.  They sewed their shirts and pants                             together to make sails.  To keep the boats from leaking, they                             rubbed sap from pine trees in the cracks between the boards.                             They collected rocks to use as ballast, which would balance                             the boats and keep them from tipping over.                                   During the month it took to build five boats, they were                             attacked again and again.  Some of the Conquistadors still had                             swords, but their best defense was simply to run.  On the day                             that the boats were finally ready to sail, Governor Narvaez                             counted his losses so far.                                                                 54","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        “Thirty-five men have died from disease and hunger,                               nineteen by attacks from Indians, and one by drowning.  Two                               hundred and forty-seven men and one horse remain.”                                      The men were so crowded on the five boats that they                               could not move.  The boats barely floated under the weight of                              men, barrels of fresh water, and what little food remained.                               With no idea where they were or where they were going, they                               pushed the boats into the sea.  Alvar’s horse was the only one                               that had survived.  Alvar looked back at it as they left the                               beach.  ‘Now you are the only Spaniard in Florida,’ Alvar                              thought to himself.  ‘Maybe the natives will find a good use                               for you.’                                                         *       *      *                                       Being in the boat only made things worse.  The men’s                               legs were cramped, and they were constantly tossed and                               rocked from side to side, with no shelter from the hot sun.                               They soon ran out of water and food.  The few small islands                               that they did find had very little food or fresh water, and the                                                                  55","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               few natives that lived there hid from the Conquistadors.  Some                             of the sickest men on the expedition chose to stay on small,                             uninhabited islands and die peacefully, away from the troubles                             of the sea.  Others, desperate for a drink, took gulps of                             saltwater from the sea.  This made them even sicker, and often                            killed them.                                    One day a group of natives paddled out to meet them in                             canoes from the mainland.  Alvar felt hope growing in his                             heart as the natives led them to the beach and gave them clay                             jars full of food and water.  Then they asked Narvaez to come                            to their village and talk with the leaders.  Alvar was still                             chewing his first bites of food when they were suddenly                             attacked.  These natives, however, did not use bows and                             arrows.  Instead, they threw rocks and spears, but these were                             just as deadly.  As the Conquistadors ran for their boats and                            began pushing them back into the sea, they saw the governor                             running for his life from the woods.  He was being chased and                             his head and face were covered in blood.                                    “Back to the sea!” he yelled, stumbling as a stone hit                             him in the back.  “Hurry, men!  These savages will kill us                            all!”                                                               56","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        After the five boats were safely in the water, Alvar                               steered his boat over to the governor’s.                                      “What happened, sir?  I thought those Indians were                               going to be friendly,” he asked.                                      “I did, too.  But when I asked them about gold... well,”                              the Governor did not finish his sentence.  He did not have to.                               Alvar knew what had happened.  He shook his head and                               looked at the governor.                                      “How could you?” Alvar asked.  “How could you think                               of gold when your men are starving to death?”                                     “But... I thought—,” the governor began to say                               something, but Alvar steered his boat away and ignored him.                               “The governor’s obsession for gold will kill us all,” he said to                               the other men in his boat.                                      A week later, a storm struck and the boats were                              separated.  Alvar was able to find the governor and his boat,                               but the other three were nowhere to be found.  The two                               remaining boats continued for several days within sight of the                               coast until they spotted smoke and other signs of native life.                               The sun was setting as they tried with all their strength to                                                                  57","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               make it to shore, but the winds and current were pushing them                             back out to sea.                                    “What should we do, Governor?” Alvar called as                             loudly as he could.                                    “Our only choice is to make it back to shore with the                            strength of our arm and oar,” said the governor.  “If we don’t                             make it now, then our boats will sink in the storm!”                                    The men in Alvar’s boat, however, were too weak.                             Only a few had the strength to sit upright.  The governor,                             however, had made sure that he had the strongest crew and the                            most maize.                                    “Governor Narvaez, I cannot keep up with you.  Please,                             throw me a rope and we can row to shore together,” Alvar                             called.                                    “But I can make the shore by nightfall,” the governor                            called back.  “You will only slow me down.”                                    “Then what do you suggest that I do?” Alvar pleaded.                                    Alvar could hear the governor laugh.  “Cabeza de                             Vaca, it is no longer a time when one man should command                             another.  Each man must do what he thinks is best to save                            himself.”                                                               58","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        With these words, the crew in the governor’s boat                               rowed with all their might toward shore.  Alvar’s men were                               too tired to react, but their hearts burned with anger.  After all                               that they had been through, the governor had simply left them                               to die!  Alvar reached into the last bag of raw maize and gave                              a small handful to each man.  They choked it down.  Raw                               maize tasted terrible, and was difficult to swallow.  For a                               week they drifted with only a handful to eat each morning                               until only Alvar was strong enough to work the sails and oars.                               They saw no signs of the other Spaniards.                                     One night, the moon shone brightly enough for Alvar                               to see the outline of distant trees on the coast.  He felt dizzy as                               the boat rocked up and down in the waves, and he was so                               weak that he thought his eyes were playing tricks on him.                                      ‘All I can do is keep the boat pointed toward shore,’                              Alvar thought.  ‘Maybe we will catch a lucky current.’  He                               heard moans from the dying men, who lay in a heap at his                               feet.  Throughout the night, his mind and body drifted in and                               out of heavy sleep.                                                                     59","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      Some time later, he woke up face down on a beach.  He                             coughed and spit out sand, then sat up.  Alvar looked around                             and saw no signs of his boat or the other men.  He was alone.                                                                                                               60","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                                                      PART TWO:                                 THE WANDERER AND THE HEALER                                                                                           61","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                                                                                                            62","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                          Alvar did not know what to do.  For hours, he rested in                               the shade.  He did not even have enough energy to search for                               water or food.  Suddenly, he noticed something move in the                               bushes at the other end of the beach.  When he looked up, he                              saw a man squatting with a bow and arrows in his hands.  The                               man had light brown skin, short hair, and a bone pierced                               through his upper lip like a thin moustache.  Alvar was too                               tired to be scared.  He looked at the man and did not move.                                      Soon, a large group had gathered to stare at Alvar, all                              of them with similarly pierced lips and weapons.  Alvar had                               seen many strange things and new people during the past                               months, but he was the first European these natives had ever                               seen.  He realized they were probably more curious about him                               than he was about them.                                     ‘I must be the strangest thing they have ever seen,’                               Alvar thought.  ‘Skinny as a skeleton, and sunburned as red as                               a crab.’                                      After a while, several women approached Alvar.  They                               placed bowls of food and water in the sand a few feet from                              him.  The women watched in amazement as Alvar scrambled                                                                63","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               toward the bowls as if he was trying to attack them.  He ate                             and drank everything they had brought.  Alvar had no idea                             what he was eating, and he did not care how it tasted.  The                             natives smiled and brought more food and water.                                    Alvar was so busy eating that he did not notice the                            natives coming closer and closer, until they were gathered in a                             circle around him.  When he finished everything, he moaned                             and rolled over on his side.  After so many weeks of hunger,                             he had eaten too much too fast.  Alvar fell into a deep sleep,                             and when he awoke, he was in a small, dark hut, wrapped in                            animal skins.  He heard people singing and drumming outside.                             When he lifted the flap of deer hide that covered the door, he                             saw many people dancing around a huge bonfire.  He closed                             the flap and crawled back into bed, and shivered with fear.                                    ‘Oh no!’ he thought.  ‘I have heard stories of wild                            dances and bonfires.  The Indians are going to eat me!’                                    All of the stories about tribes of cannibals, and the                             terrible things they did to Conquistadors in Mexico and other                             places, filled Alvar’s head.  He did not know what to do.  Just                             when he made up his mind to escape, however, the deer hide                            flap lifted up.  Alvar made himself as small as possible                                                               64","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 beneath the blankets.  When he peeked at the door, he saw a                               man covered from head to toe in red paint with raccoon fur                               wrapped around his head.  His chest, face, and arms were                               pierced with many thin bones.  The man walked across the hut                               and pulled Alvar’s blankets away.                                     “No!  Please don’t eat me!” Alvar screamed.                                      The man called to someone else outside.  A woman                               came in with a jug of water and knelt beside Alvar.  Using a                               soft rag, she sponged water onto his face and hands, then                               poured some over his hair.  Alvar looked at the woman’s face.                              She would not look into his eyes, but he knew as he watched                               her wash him that he was not in danger.  He felt like a fool for                               having been so afraid.  ‘These people are not cannibals,’ he                               thought.  ‘They saved my life.’                                      Alvar was allowed to stay in the natives’ village, and as                              the weeks passed he learned a lot about the people and their                               way of life.  They called themselves Capoques, and Alvar was                               able to learn their language.  As it turned out, the man who                               had been painted in red dye during the bonfire took Alvar into                               his own home.  His name was Flies With Hawk, because                              when he was a child he fell from a tall tree and was not hurt.                                                                65","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               His wife, who had washed Alvar, was named Fighting Wind,                             because she had been born during a bad hurricane.  Alvar was                             glad that, like all of the Capoques, his own name had special                             meaning.  The Capoques listened carefully to his story of why                             he was named ‘Cabeza de Vaca,’ unlike the governor and                            most other people Alvar had known.                                    They lived on an island not far from the mainland, but                             only in the winter.  It was hard to find food in the winter, and                             the Capoques were not a powerful tribe.  This island was the                             only place the Capoques could find food where they would                            not have to fight other tribes.  Alvar called this the Isle of                             Misfortune because life was so hard here.                                    Their main food was roots, which they boiled and                             mashed into a soupy mixture with a little fish, or whatever                             else they could find.  Each day Alvar joined the Capoques in                            the shallows of the creeks and sea where they gathered roots,                             because the ground above water was too frozen to dig.  The                             more time Alvar spent with them, the more surprised he was                             by their customs.                                    He had never met people who loved their children                            more than the Capoques.  As a child in Spain, Alvar had been                                                               66","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 taught to respect, and even to fear his parents and other elders,                               and certainly never to question them.  Capoque parents were                               very tender and loving, which was nothing like what he                               expected from people who were supposedly savage.  Until                               they were twelve years old, and big enough to work, the                              children were free to play and explore their world.  Life was                               not easy on the Isle of Misfortune, but hearing the laughter                               and playful cries of the children each day made everything a                               little better.                                      During the winter several children fell ill and died.                              When this happened, the whole tribe joined the family in                               mourning the loss.  Each day at dawn, and then again at noon,                               the parents and relatives of the dead child would cover                               themselves in ash from the fire and cry for an hour.  They                               continued this for a whole year.  The rest of the tribe would                              give the family food, because people in mourning were not                               allowed to gather their own.  Of course, this made everything                               more difficult for the Capoques, because it meant fewer hands                               were available to dig roots.                                      The winter was cold, and everyone was hungry and                              sick.  Most of the people got better, but Alvar was not used to                                                                67","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               the germs, and his body did not recover quickly.  Every night                             he would lie awake sweating, wild with fever.  At the same                             time, he felt cold, and horrible chills swept through his body.                             He grew even thinner, and his skin took on a yellowish color.                             None of the Capoque healers were able to help him.                                   “Cabeza de Vaca?  Can you hear me?  It is Flies With                             Hawk.  Wake up, Cabeza de Vaca.”                                    “I am cold,” Alvar groaned.  “Will you build up the                             fire?”                                    “The fire is burning.  Stay still and rest,” Flies With                            Hawk said, wiping the sweat from Alvar’s brow.  “I have                             come to tell you that the rest of us are going to the mainland                             because winter is over.  It is time to eat oysters and                             blackberries.  You must stay here.  You are too weak to travel.                             Do not worry, Cabeza de Vaca.  You will not be alone.”                                   The words faded from Alvar’s mind, and everything                             became dim.                                                        *      *      *                                                                   68","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        When Alvar awoke, he did not know how many days                               or weeks had passed.  Beside him sat a man who, though his                               face looked like an adult, was no taller than a young child.                               There was also a man who Alvar recognized as one of the                               Capoque healers.  He wore deerskin and carried a long stick                              decorated with many feathers and sea beads.  The springtime                               air was warm and Alvar felt much better.  He was still in the                               Capoque village, but the other people were gone.  Outside,                               Alvar also found an elderly couple, and a blind child.                                      They ate fish and berries until the roots were once                              again ready to be harvested in the late summer.  But Alvar                               was the only one strong enough to gather enough food for                               everyone.  He had no tools other than his hands with which to                               dig the roots, and within a few days, his fingers were worn out                               and bloody.  Gradually the skin on Alvar’s hands became as                              tough as leather.  When summer changed into fall, he got used                               to the cold, even though he had no clothing other than a                               loincloth made of wooly moss from the tree limbs.                                      Each day he delivered food to the elderly couple and                               blind boy, but he never spoke a word to them, or even learned                              their names. The dwarf followed Alvar everywhere he went,                                                                69","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               running to keep up with Alvar’s long strides.  The two became                             good friends.  Around the evening fire, the healer taught Alvar                             spiritual dances, healing rituals, and different languages.                             Alvar, in turn, explained the story of his own people.                                    “I came from a land far away, in the direction of the                            rising sun,” Alvar said.  “My king is a great and powerful                             man, for he alone commands half of the land on earth.  We                             came here to explore new land and make our great king even                             more powerful.  But we have not been lucky.  I do not know                             what happened to the other men.  If they are all dead, as I fear                            they are, then why am I the only one left alive?”                                    “Every person’s life is special,” the healer said, stirring                             the coals in the fire.  “And the spirits that live in the rocks,                             trees, and water sometimes do things that we do not                             understand.   I know that you do not believe in the same spirits                            I see and talk to.  There are many people living in this land.                             We Capoques are just one of many, many tribes, and all of us                             believe in different things.  You come from across the sea, and                             do not look like any man I have ever met.  But I can see that                             you and I are not much different.  The spirits, or your God,                            have special plans for you.”                                                               70","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        “What kind of plans?” Alvar asked.                                      “That is not for me to say.  You will learn soon                               enough,” the healer said, rising to his feet.                                      Alvar did not sleep much that night.  He awoke as the                               sun was rising and walked down to the beach.  He could see                              the mainland in the distance, and as he stared at it he thought                               about his life.  He had been stripped of everything: his dreams                               of conquering, his possessions, and even his friends.  Alvar                               had seen so much suffering and strangeness that he was no                               longer afraid of anything.  His head was filled with questions                              that could not be answered if he stayed on the island, so he                               decided to run away.  “I am an explorer, so that is what I shall                               do,” he said out loud.                                      “What do you mean?” said the dwarf, who had been                               standing behind him for some time.                                      “Nothing, I was not talking to you,” replied Alvar.                                      “There is no food and I am hungry, so get to work,” the                               dwarf demanded, poking him with his stick.                                      “Okay, my little friend, I will get your breakfast, and                               your lunch, and your dinner,” Alvar said, picking the dwarf up                              and carrying him on his shoulder.                                                                71","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      Alvar worked hard and by noon he had picked enough                             roots to last a week.  He placed the pile of roots outside the                             healer’s hut and walked to the beach.  His only possessions                             were his moss loincloth and a handful of roots, which he                             tucked into his waistband.  The mainland was three miles                            away through cold, rough water, but Alvar was ready.  He was                             very thin compared to when he left Spain, but every muscle                             was strong, and his body was used to the cold, and hard work.                                    Alvar had to pace himself and save as much energy as                             possible because he had never attempted to swim so far.  Each                            time he lifted his head from the water for breath he heard the                             dwarf’s voice calling for him to return, but Alvar knew he had                             to keep going.  The dwarf’s voice grew softer until it was                             nothing more than an echo in Alvar’s memory.  By the time                             Alvar washed up on the beach of the mainland, completely                            exhausted, he could hear nothing but the waves and a bird                             singing in a nearby tree.                                    Two years had passed, and now Alvar Nuñez Cabeza                             de Vaca, Conquistador and officer to the King of Spain, was                             completely alone on an unknown shore.  He had no gold, no                            possessions, no army, no friends, and no king.  He pulled his                                                               72","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 knees to his chest and sat on the beach staring at the moon and                               stars.  He stayed awake all night until the first rays of morning                               sun touched his face.                                                         *       *      *                                       Alvar heard a noise in the forest behind him, but he did                               not turn to see what it was.  At first he ignored the sound,                               hoping it was an animal.  But soon he heard human voices,                               followed by many footsteps.  The moment he turned in the                              direction of the noises, a native man stumbled onto the beach                               with an arrow through his shoulder. Alvar was horrified by the                               sight, and became sick.  Alvar jumped back into the frigid sea                               for protection as dozens of native warriors spilled onto the                               beach.                                     He kept only his eyes and nose above the water. The                               two groups fought with fists and clubs, and then both                               retreated, leaving injured men behind.  They shouted threats to                               one another from a safe distance, then clashed again, this time                               dragging some of the wounded to safety.  They repeated this                                                                  73","C a b eza  d e V a ca                      twice and then one group ran away back into the woods.                    Alvar had never seen a battle like that.                           Alvar emerged from the water and approached the                    winners, who were busy counting their losses, and bragging                   about their brave deeds.  He recognized them as Capoques.                           “Flies With Hawk!  Is that you?  It is me, Cabeza de                    Vaca.”                           “I am surprised to see you alive,” Flies With Hawk                    laughed and patted Alvar’s back.  “But I knew you had a                    strong will to live.”                          They walked to the village where the Capoques were                    spending the spring and summer.  Alvar asked why they had                    not returned to the island to get him during the winter.  Flies                    with Hawk explained that soon after leaving the island, a war                    began with a tribe called the Atayos.  The fighting had driven                   the Capoques so far inland that they were not able to return to                    the island.                           “The war has spread to many tribes, and it has taken us                    this long to fight our way back to the coast,” explained Flies                    With Hawk.  “We are cut off from our friends in other tribes,                                                        74","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 and are too busy fighting to travel inland and get the things we                               need, and the inland villages cannot reach the shore.  We must                               fight every day just to keep the Atayos from burning our                               homes, for they outnumber us.”                                      “Why are you fighting the Atayos?” Alvar asked.                                     “There has been a long drought, and there is not much                               food in the land.  Since the Atayos are the most powerful                               tribe, they are trying to kill the rest of us so they can have it all                               for themselves.”                                      Later that night, Alvar went to the hut of one of the                              Capoque elders named Tall Bear.  They had won the battle on                               the beach, but still had little reason to celebrate, because they                               knew that the Atayos would soon return.                                      “With today’s victory, we might soon be able to force                               the Atayos from the coast and then help our friends further                              inland,” Tall Bear said to Alvar.  “The only problem is that we                               are running out of the things we need to fight.  You are the                               only able adult who has no commitment to the war or family.                               My people are too busy to trade with our friends, but maybe                               you can travel inland and help us.”                                                                  75","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      “I will be happy to trade with other tribes,” Alvar said.                             “It will give me a chance to explore the land and meet new                             people.  Maybe I will even be able to find other men from my                             expedition.”                                    The next morning Alvar set out for the village of the                            Avavares with a bundle of goods for trade.  He carried sea                             beads and special shells, which were used as knives to cut                             fruit.  “The beads and shells are very valuable to the                             Avavares,” Flies With Hawk explained.  “In return, we need                             flint for arrowheads, reeds for arrow shafts, and animal                            hides—as many as you can get.”                                    “Follow this trail in the direction of the rising sun until                             you come to a great river,” said Tall Bear. “Follow the river’s                             current and you will find the Avavares.”                                    “But how do I know that the Avavares will not just                            steal the things that I carry?” Alvar asked.                                    “They are not thieves, they are our friends.  The                             Avavares will welcome you when you say that you were sent                             by Tall Bear.”                                    After giving him as much food as he could carry, and                            telling him where he could find drinking water, Flies With                                                               76","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 Hawk sent Alvar on his way.  Others followed after Alvar                               asking that he bring back ocher, which was used to make a                               dye for their hair and faces, as well as sacred ornaments that                               the people of the interior made from deer hair.                                      The backpack Alvar carried, made of deer hide and                              sticks, was almost as tall as he was and rose more than an                               arm’s length above his head.  Alvar walked for three hours,                               but got tired under the weight of the pack.  The land was very                               hot and dry.  He collapsed under shade of a bush and fell                               asleep.  Again, he was alone.  He thought to himself how                              strange and funny it was that out of all the things he came to                               the New World to do, the last thing he expected was to                               become a common trader with a bundle of trinkets and tools.                                                         *       *      *                                       When he awoke, the temperature had dropped, and he                               shivered in the darkness.  The moon was bright, so he decided                               to continue walking.  He walked until morning, and then slept                               once more through the midday heat.                                                                  77","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      On the fifth day he came to the river, and by the next                             morning he spotted thin lines of smoke rising from a shallow                             valley.  Two Avavare scouts came out to meet him, and he                             greeted them as Flies With Hawk had instructed, telling them                             that he was sent by Tall Bear, and that he carried goods to                            trade.  They led him to an open area in the center of the                             village.                                    Alvar was unlike any man they had ever seen.  Many                             children surrounded him and giggled at his thin frame and                             sunburned skin.  He bent over, letting them tug at his beard                            and wild hair.  The Avavares looked like the Capoques in                             some ways, but only the women had pierced lips.  Many of the                             men had small spots tattooed on their arms and faces.                                    Alvar spread all the goods from the Capoques on the                             ground and sat facing an Avavare elder named Red Bird.  The                            Avavares were happy with what they saw, though they did not                             need so many of the shell knives or beads.                                    “The Capoques say they need hides, flints, dried reeds,                             ocher , and something else—,” Alvar said, trying to remember                             all the things they told him as he left the village so many days                            before.  “Oh yes, ornaments made of deer hair.”                                                               78","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        Red Bird shouted out instructions to several others to                               bring animal hides and flints.  On the trading mat, Red Bird                               placed three deer hides and enough flint to make about one                               hundred arrowheads.  They also brought many of the dried                               reeds that were used as arrow shafts, but Alvar could see                              plainly that these were not uncommon in the area, and                               probably not worth much to the Avavares.                                      “As you know,” Alvar said, “the Capoques are at war                               and in great need of more arrows and animal hides.  But for                               what you offer, I will gladly give you this many beads and                              shells.”  Alvar began placing many of the shells and beads                               back into his pack, because he did not think the Avavares                               were offering enough for his goods.  But Red Bird motioned                               for him to stop.                                      “We are at war also, and cannot spare much flint, but                              we will give you more hides,” he said motioning to one of the                               others.  He spoke quietly with several other men, and when                               they had all agreed, a large bundle of red deer-hair ornaments                               and ocher was placed before Alvar.                                      He spent three days with the Avavares.  During this                              time he was treated very well, and was free to walk about the                                                                79","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               village and talk with the people.  The more Alvar understood                             about the people of this land, including their customs and                             lifestyles, the more he realized that there was more to gain by                             learning from them than by conquering them.  What Alvar                             liked most about these people was that they did not have a                            king.  Instead, everyone took part in making decisions, and                             then the elders, like Red Bird, spoke for the whole tribe.  Even                             though life was not easy, the people celebrated every night                             with dancing.                                    The Avavares told Alvar to go visit a nearby tribe                            called the Culalchiches, because they had more flint.  It took                             Alvar an extra week to reach this village, and by the time he                             returned to the Capoques, they were worried.  Flies With                             Hawk noticed Alvar first and ran to greet him.                                    “We thought you might have been lost or dead,” he                            said.                                    “No.  I visited the Culalchiches, because they had a lot                             of flint to spare and said they would give me a great deal more                             if I could bring them some sea snails.  Do your people have                             any?”                                                                 80","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        “There are more sea snails further up the coast, with                               the people called Guayones.  Take them some ornaments and                               ocher, because you have brought us more than we need,” Flies                               with Hawk said.  “Then return to the Culalchiches and get                               more flint.  Also, there is another kind of reed which is ground                              up and used to make glue.  We can use some of that.”                                      The Capoques celebrated Alvar’s return with a great                               feast, and praised him for his courage.  After he was fully                               rested, he headed off towards the Guayone village to trade for                               snails.  Before he even reached his destination, he was                              intercepted by a small party of men who were from                               another tribe called the Yguazes.  Seeing that Alvar had ocher,                               they asked that he come to their village as soon as possible.                               Alvar was amazed that there were so many tribes in the land,                               and at first he had trouble remembering their names.  He had                              thought, before leaving Spain, that all the natives in the New                               World would simply be savages.  Instead, he found that all the                               tribes—though different in certain ways—lived by ancient                               customs, and understood how to survive the forces of nature.                                                                     81","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      As he traveled between villages, Alvar suffered greatly                             from the weather, hunger, and thirst, but the people he met                             were always ready to give him food and a comfortable place                             to rest.  Soon, he was famous among all the tribes, both on the                             coast and inland.  The different tribes had not been able to                            trade for a long time because of war and the difficulty of                             finding food.  Not only did Alvar fill this need, but he was                             also interesting to all of the natives because of the way he                             looked.                                    Alvar was happier as a trader than he had ever been in                            his life.  He was free to come and go as he pleased.  His body                             was strong and healthy.  He learned about plants and animals.                             He talked with strangers, and learned about their history and                             many languages.                                    Alvar’s pack became heavier and larger every day as                            he discovered new and valuable things to trade.  He always                             carried as many reeds and furs as possible, all piled high                             above his head.  His pack was stuffed with a variety of shells,                             flint, beads, herbs, snails, ocher, and stone tools.  Deer-hair                             ornaments in several colors and sizes, as well as animal tails                            and bones, dangled from the sides of his pack.  People always                                                               82","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 laughed when they saw him coming, because from a distance                               he looked more like a strange monster than a man.                                                         *       *      *                                       Four winters passed, and Alvar came into contact with                               dozens of tribes and villages—more than he could count.  He                               learned more about the tribes’ different customs, and often                               thought that it would be good if people in Spain acted more                               like the natives of the New World.                                     One day, when he was back in the village of the                               Avavares, where he had made his first trade, two men started                               fighting because one had accused the other of being a coward                               in battle.  Most of the Avavares went about their chores and                               ignored the argument, even as the two men wrestled and                              kicked up a cloud of dust in the middle of the village.  They                               used no weapons other than their powerful muscles.  When                               the two were exhausted, they crawled back to their huts.  A                               few minutes later, both men appeared again carrying some                               basic belongings and tools.                                                                  83","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      “What are they doing?” Alvar asked one of the women                             who was looking through his collection of beads.                                    “They have fought, so now they must both move away                             from the village until they are no longer angry.”                                    “Then what will happen?”                                   “Nothing.  They will come back to village and be                             friends again.”                                    Alvar watched the men as they stormed away from the                             village in opposite directions.  ‘That makes good sense,’ Alvar                             thought.  ‘In time, both men will realize that their fight was                            stupid, and that there are more important things in life.’                                    One autumn, Alvar traveled with the Capoques to eat                             walnuts, which they did for at least a month each year.  The                             Atayos, with whom the Capoques were still at war, also ate                             walnuts at that time of year.  The Capoques knew their                            enemies could attack at any time, so they were very careful.                             At night, the women and children slept in the middle of the                             forest, well hidden under thick bushes and trees.  The men                             built waist-high huts in a circle around the women and                             children, and covered the huts with branches and leaves.                                                                 84","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        The men slept during the day, because they had to stay                               on guard all night long.  Alvar stayed in Flies With Hawk’s                               small hut at night.  Around midnight, they heard a scream,                               followed by voices calling out that the village was under                               attack.  Flies With Hawk stood up, lifting the little hut                              completely from the ground, and ran towards the center of the                               village.  Alvar was not expected to fight because he was not                               part of the tribe.  Besides, he had not used a weapon in a long                               time, and knew that he would only get himself killed if he                               tried to fight.  Alvar stayed close to the ground and hid behind                              a tree to watch the battle.                                      In all of his life, Alvar had never seen men as brave as                               the Capoques.  Surrounded and outnumbered, protected only                               by the dimness of the moon, they stood their ground and                               dodged the enemy’s storm of arrows.  Warriors were                              everywhere, and Alvar could not tell who was who.  The air                               was filled with screams and cries of women and children as                               they tried to find safety.  Eventually the warriors from both                               sides used up all of their arrows, so they gathered their dead                               and wounded and returned to their villages.  This surprised                              Alvar, because the Atayos still outnumbered the Capoques                                                                85","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               and could have wiped them out if they continued fighting with                             knives and clubs.  It was their custom, however, that when the                             arrows were gone the fight was over.                                    Soon the Capoque village was filled with the moans of                             the wounded and the crying of the families whose men had                            fallen.  The Capoque healers were busy trying to save the                             wounded warriors.  They danced around the bleeding                             warriors, and sometimes bent down to whisper in their ears.                             They also passed hot stones over the warriors and put strange                             smelling ointments on the wounds.                                   Many of the wounded warriors stopped moaning and                             seemed to feel better.  But there were too many wounded men,                             and soon the healers were tired and could do no more.                                    ‘I cannot just stand here and watch these men die,’                             Alvar thought.  ‘I must try to help them.’                                   One of the warriors had an arrowhead lodged in his                             chest.  Alvar remembered the things that the healer had taught                             him back on the island.  He knelt beside the man and                             examined the wound.  Somebody had snapped the shaft of the                             arrow, but the head was buried deep in the man’s breast.                                                                 86","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        All the people, including the healers, gathered around                               when they noticed Alvar kneeling and preparing to do                               something, though they did not know what to expect.                                      “What is your name?” Alvar asked.                                      “I am Little Son.”                                     “I know you are afraid, Little Son, but you must trust                               me.  I will do everything in my power to save you.”                                      Alvar used a razor sharp shell knife to make a small cut                               near the wound.  Little Son’s blood flowed freely, so Alvar                               soaked it up with some deerskin.  Seeing that the arrowhead                              was stuck between two ribs, and would be very difficult to                               remove, he made a second, deeper cut with the knife.  There                               was not a sound in the camp, even from Little Son who had                               passed out from the pain.  With great difficulty, Alvar was                               finally able to free the arrowhead.  It was as long as his index                              finger and made from jagged deer bone.  He stitched up the                               wound with needles and string and placed hot stones on it to                               stop the bleeding.                                      “I think he is going to live,” Alvar said when he had                               finished, “but we must keep an eye on him.”                                                                  87","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      The next day, the women said that they were going to                             try and make peace with the Atayos.  The Capoques told                             Alvar that the women always made peace, and that this was                             the way among all the tribes.  They showed the deer-bone                             arrowhead to their Atayos, and told how Alvar had healed                            Little Son.  The two sides agreed that enough blood had been                             shed, and that the healing was a sign that they should make                             peace.  Later in the day, the warriors from the two tribes met                             face to face and traded bows and arrows as a sign of                             friendship.                                   Then the people began to sing and dance.  Alvar sat                             against a tree and watched, but soon Flies With Hawk and                             Fighting Wind asked him to join in the dance.                                    “No thank you,” Alvar said, because he did not think                             he knew how to dance.  “I am happy just watching.”                                   But he could not help moving his feet as the singing                             and drumming got louder and faster.  Soon his arms and head                             were moving, too.  Alvar was very happy and laughed like he                             never had before.  He continued to dance, sing, and laugh all                             night with the Capoques and Atayos.  At one point, as he took                                                                 88","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 a break to drink some water, he thought to himself, ‘I wonder                               what Governor Narvaez would think if he saw me now?’                                      A week later, Alvar announced that it was time for him                               to move on, for he had promises to keep to other tribes.                                      “No, you are no longer a trader, strange one, for you                              have strong medicine,” said Little Son.  “You are meant to be                               a healer.”                                      “He is right, Cabeza de Vaca,” added Flies With Hawk.                                      “No I am not,” Alvar said, unable to believe that he                               was truly a healer.  “The only miracle is that my clumsy hands                              did not kill you, Little Son.”                                      “Soon we will travel to the mountains to eat prickly                               pears,” said Flies With Hawk, ignoring Alvar’s protests.                               “There we will meet with many tribes.  Stay with us until                               then.”                                                        *       *      *                                        Prickly pears were red, black, and about the size of an                               egg.  When Alvar bit into his first one, he giggled as the sweet                              juice dripped down his chin.  It was a joyous time, with much                                                                89","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               dancing and singing, for every day they ate prickly pears was                             a day of celebration.  There was still a terrible drought in the                             land, but the prickly pears had managed to stay alive and                             grow.  Now they were almost the only food available, but                             there was plenty for everyone.  Thousands of people came                            from all over the land to feast and celebrate.  Old enemies                             made peace with one another, for as long as there were prickly                             pears, the people had all they needed.  Many of the people                             believed that it was because of Alvar’s power that the prickly                             pears had continued to grow during the drought and the tribes                            had all made peace.                                    Alvar had seen most of the tribes at least once before,                             and was used to their differences and appearances.  Still, he                             was amazed to see so many of them together.  Every group                             had its own face paints, clothing, and special arrows.  Some                            were naked and starving when they came to the valley of the                             prickly pears; some stood tall and proud, dressed from head to                             toe in fine feathers and furs.                                    As Alvar looked at the crowd, he noticed one large,                             strong warrior with battle scars all over his body.  To Alvar’s                            surprise, the warrior wore a horseshoe around his neck.                                                               90","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 Natives did not have horses.  Then he saw that the man had a                               Spanish sword tied to his waist.                                      “Where did you get that?” Alvar demanded.                                      “It came from other men with beards like yours, but                               they were dressed differently,” the warrior said.  “They                              carried long spears and rode strange animals that had these on                               their feet,” he continued, handing Alvar the horseshoe.  “But                               my people fought them and sent them running back to the                               southern mountains.”                                      Alvar could not believe what he was hearing!  This                              meant that other Spaniards were not far away.  ‘The                               Conquistadors must be making their way north from Mexico,’                               Alvar thought.                                      “What is your name?” Alvar asked.                                      “I am Bull Head.  I come from the land of the Zuñi                              tribes.”                                      “You must take me to your village, Bull Head,” said                               Alvar.  “I need to find the other men with beards like mine.                               Your people might have fought them off this time, but more                               will come.”                                     “How do you know?” asked Bull Head.                                                                91","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      “It is hard to explain, but you must believe me.  They                             plan to conquer this land, as I did when I first came here.”                                    Everyone was surprised by Alvar’s words.  “You do                             not look like a warrior,” someone said.                                    “But you did not know me many years ago.  I, too, rode                            a horse and carried a spear.”                                    Bull Head agreed to take Alvar to his village, and to                             help him find the other Spaniards.  Many other natives,                             especially the Capoques, wanted to go with Alvar, because                             they believed that he had great power.                                   “Keep us healthy, Cabeza de Vaca,” they begged.                             “Protect us with your power.”                                    “But I am not as powerful as you say I am,” Alvar said.                             “I only want to find the other men like me, so that I can keep                             them from hurting you.”                                   But Alvar’s words only made more people want to stay                             with him.  “If you are able to stop the men with beards who                             ride horses, then you cannot say that you don’t have power.”                                    “I only said that I will try to stop them from conquering                             you,” Alvar insisted.                                                                 92","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        Flies With Hawk was able to help Alvar convince most                               of the people to stay at home.  After all, there were many                               children and elderly people who were not fit to travel through                               the harsh land to Bull Head’s village.  Still, nearly one                               hundred Capoques and people from other tribes followed                              Alvar.                                                         *       *      *                                        After walking south-west through the mountains for                              two difficult weeks, Alvar was relieved when they arrived at                               Bull Head’s village.  The houses were made of clay and were                               strong fixtures in the dry but fertile land.  The people were tall                               and muscular, and healthier than any other natives Alvar had                               met.  The women were busy grinding maize, soaking dried                              beans, and peeling squash.  As he explored the village, Alvar                               noticed large holes in the ground that served as storage cellars                               and were filled with food.                                      The people of the village had cotton blankets that were                               finer than the best Alvar had seen in Spain—soft, heavy, and                              colored with bright dyes.  The women wore cotton tunics and                                                                93","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               long skirts made of deerskin.  Also, these people wore shoes                             and sandals made of deer-hide.  Glancing down at his own                             scarred, bare feet, Alvar realized just how long it had been                             since he had even thought about shoes.                                    Bull Head’s people showed Alvar a new way to cook.                            Gourds were very common in this part of the land.  The                             natives hollowed out the pulp of the gourd, leaving only the                             thin, hard outer shell.  They filled the shell with water and                             dropped in red-hot stones until it boiled.  Then they added                             beans and squash.  As the food cooked, they removed the cool                            rocks and continued to add hot ones.  It had been a long time                             since Alvar had enjoyed a meal as tasty and filling as beans                             and squash, and there was more than enough for his friends                             and followers.                                    Little Son and some of the other Capoques told                            everyone that Alvar had healing powers, and that he would                             bring peace and prosperity to their land.  Alvar no longer tried                             to deny that he was a healer, especially because people treated                             him very well if they thought he had power.                                    “But as you can see, we are strong and already have                            plenty of food,” a woman named Slow Eagle told Little Son.                                                               94","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 “If Cabeza de Vaca truly has powers, then he should go to the                               other Zuñi people, who live over the mountains.  Many of                               them are sick and in great danger.”                                      “From what?” asked Alvar.                                      “I do not know,” Slow Eagle responded.  “Two weeks                              ago another Zuñi tribe sent a messenger to ask us for help                               against a great evil that was passing through the land.  The                               messenger died from exhaustion before he could explain, and                               when we arrived at their homes, all of them were all gone.”                                      Although Alvar did not know exactly where he was, he                              knew that they had been traveling south for some time, and                               that perhaps Mexico was not far away.  He was afraid, from                               what Slow Eagle told him, that another expedition of                               Conquistadors were responsible for the ‘evil’ things, and so he                               asked Slow Eagle and Bull Head to guide him to the home of                              this other Zuñi tribe.  All of the people in this area called                               themselves Zuñi, though they also had different names and                               many villages.  Even more people followed Alvar now, to see                               if he truly had the power of a healer.                                                       *       *      *                                                                  95","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      Alvar’s heart filled with sadness and tears rolled down                             his cheeks.  He was standing on a small hill, and stretched out                             before him was a large, carefully cultivated field of maize.                             Normally, this would have made him happy, but this field had                             not been harvested, and now every bit of its precious crop was                            rotten.                                    “The village was over there, in the river valley,” said                             Bull Head.  “But you will not find anything there because the                             people burned everything before they left.”                                    “But why?  And where did they go?” asked Alvar.                                   “They did not want to leave anything for their                             enemies,” Bull Head explained.  “They probably went into the                             hills, but I do not know for sure.”                                    They searched the burned village and, as they expected,                             found no signs that anyone had been there recently.  Little Son                            spotted a trickle of smoke rising above the trees in the distant                             hills and they soon discovered some of the people from the                             abandoned village, mostly women and children.  They were                             all starving, and had eaten only roots and tree bark for three                             weeks.  When these hungry people first saw the thick black                                                                 96","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 beard on Alvar’s face, they were scared and some of them                               tried to run away.                                      “This woman says men on horses attacked their village                               and killed and wounded many of the people before they left,”                               Bull Head explained.  “A few days later, some scouts reported                              that many more men and horses were returning, so they                               abandoned the village.  She also says most of the men of the                               village were caught before they could escape, and the men on                               horses took them away in chains.”                                      “Tell these people that we must find the men on horses                              so we can tell them not to harm or enslave anyone else,” Alvar                               told Bull Head.                                      “The women say that there is a large village farther up                               in the hills where people from many tribes have gathered to                               get away from the men with horses.  They are afraid to go                              there, for it will take many days to walk there, and the village                               is well hidden.”                                      “We must find this secret village,” Alvar insisted.                               Then he pointed to the horseshoe that Bull Head wore around                               his neck.  “You beat them once, but they will come back                                                                  97","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               stronger.  This is only the first of many villages that will be                             burned.”                                    “The people are too afraid,” said Slow Eagle.  “They                             say that the men with beards and horses are looking for them.                             They do not want to be taken away in chains.”                                   Alvar sat in the shade and thought for a long time about                             his years of wandering and living with the natives of this land.                             He had learned to respect their way of life, and no longer had                             the heart of a conqueror.  Alvar knew that as long as                             Europeans believed there was gold in the New World, then                            they would not stop until all of the land was conquered.  Even                             though the natives were brave fighters—the bravest he had                             ever met—they would not be able to hold off all of Europe                             with its guns, cannons, and kings’ armies.  Alvar did not want                             to see the native culture destroyed, as it had been in Mexico,                            so he tried to think of a way that natives and Europeans could                             live side by side.  ‘If I can only convince the Spaniards that                             these people are not savage, then maybe I can save them,’                             Alvar thought.  ‘Little Son has told all the people that I have                             power.  Maybe I do, though not as a healer.’                                                                 98","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        Then Alvar got an idea.  When Europeans looked at a                               native, they saw people dressed in animal skins, bodies                               pierced and tattooed, and grass huts.  Based on the way                               natives looked, the Europeans assumed they were savage.                               Alvar knew this was not true, and he hoped that if he could                              somehow make the natives look different in the eyes of the                               Spaniards, then perhaps he could save them.                                      He hoped that this would indeed be so, as they set off                               to find the secret village.                                                        *       *      *                                        Everyone in the hidden village had stories to share with                               Alvar about the terrible things that the men with beards had                               done.                                     “They came in the night, without warning,” one woman                               said.  “They took my whole family away.”                                      “They set our village on fire, and killed all the men and                               boys,” said another.                                      There were far fewer men of fighting age among the                              natives than there were children and older women.  Most of                                                                99","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               the younger women had been taken as slaves, and most of the                             men were dead, or scattered in small groups throughout the                             desert and mountains, doing whatever they could to fight the                             Spaniards.                                    Alvar stood next to a slow-flowing river and listened to                            the natives’ stories.  All of a sudden, the glint of something                             shiny in the stream caught Alvar’s eye.                                    “Gold!” he exclaimed.  He reached into the stream and                             picked up a large nugget.  ‘This is what all the men from the                             Narvaez expedition died for,’ he thought.                                   When Bull Head saw the nugget, he told Alvar that the                             hills and streams were filled with gold, as well as silver.  “My                             people do not have much use for these rocks,” he said,                             casually tossing the nugget back into the river.  “What do your                             people use it for?”                                   Alvar thought for a moment, but could not remember                             exactly why gold was so important.  He did not know how                             many years had passed since he had seen it. In all that time, he                             certainly had not needed gold, and he could not think of any                             reason that it would be important now.  He realized that if the                            Spaniards knew that these mountains and streams were full of                                                              100","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 gold (if they did not know already), then it would only make                               them more eager to conquer the land and people.                                      “It is very hard to explain why these rocks are                               important to my people,\" Alvar said. “I’m not even sure that I                               understand myself.”                                                          *       *      *                                        “We found a clearing in the woods where many of our                              people were chained together,” a Zuñi scout explained.  “I hid                               behind the trees and watched the men on horses take them                               away.”                                      “Do you know where they are taking the people in                               chains?” Alvar asked.                                     “Not for sure, but there are many fresh horse trails in                               the area, and most of them go south.”                                      “Then the Spanish are not far away,” Alvar said, a                               nervous feeling swelling in his chest.  “We will find them and                               try to talk to them.”                                                                  101","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      Without wasting any time, he walked south with Slow                             Eagle, Little Son, and eleven others in the direction of the                             fresh horse trails.  Three hours from the hidden village, they                             found extinguished campfires and fresh horse tracks.                             Throughout the day they followed the trail of clues until, late                            in the afternoon, they heard Spanish voices calling to one                             another in the forest.                                    “It is not a good idea to sneak up on them, or they                             might think it’s an ambush,” said Little Son.                                    As Alvar crept towards the Spanish voices, he quietly                            rehearsed what he was going to say.  “I am Alvar Nuñez                             Cabeza de Vaca of the—no that will not work... Do not be                             alarmed, I am Spanish—no...”                                    It had been so long since Alvar had spoken a word of                             Spanish, that he was having trouble remembering the words.                            He felt his long beard and tangled hair, and looked down at                             his deerskin clothing.  ‘They will not even believe that I am                             Spanish,’ Alvar thought.  ‘I wish I had thought more about                             this, but now it’s too late.’                                    Alvar hid behind a bush and peeked between two                            branches at the soldiers.  There were four of them on horses.                                                              102","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 Their armor was covered with mud and weeds.  Two carried                               lances, two carried muskets, and all of them were doing their                               best to prod their horses forward through the thick forest.                                      “Do you see a trail, Lazaro?” one of them asked.                                      “No, there is nothing.  I think the river is this way.”                                     Before he realized what he was doing, Alvar stood and                               revealed himself to the Conquistadors.  “No, the river is back                               that way,” he said in Spanish.                                      Alvar’s sudden appearance startled one of the horses,                               and it whinnied and reared, kicking its front legs high into the                              air.  It was clear that the Conquistadors were curious and                               frightened by Alvar.  They looked at him as though they were                               looking at a ghost.  A moment later, Little Son and the other                               natives stepped out of the brush.  One of the Conquistadors                               instinctively lit the fuse on his musket and raised it to his                              shoulder, but the one named Lazaro reached over and                               extinguished the fuse between his fingers.                                      “You are Spanish?” asked Lazaro.                                      “My name is Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca.

After an hour’s walk they reached the camp of Captain                               Diego de Alcaraz where there were about one hundred                               soldiers and fifty native prisoners.  It was clear that everyone                              in the camp was suffering from hunger and sickness.  They                               limped towards Alvar and surrounded him with curious stares.                               He introduced himself and gave a brief account of the fate of                               the Narvaez expedition.  He spoke slowly, sometimes mixing                               up his Spanish with words from native languages.  Alvar                              realized that his story was only confusing the soldiers, for                               what he told them went against many of the things they                               believed about the natives.                                      “We have also been lost, though not for as long as                               you,” Captain Alcaraz chuckled.  “Two months ago we were                              sent from the settlement of Culican.

In Culican, there was only a fort, soldiers’ barracks,                             and small houses and farms.                                    “I hope you will excuse us, Señor Cabeza de Vaca, we                            have not yet had even an opportunity to build our churches,”                             Governor Guzman said.  “I knew Panfilo Narvaez, though                             until now I have heard nothing of his fate.

Yes, for me it                             has been worth the suffering.”                                    Alvar talked with the governor for many hours trying                             to make him understand that the natives should not be harmed,                                                                110","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 and that if Guzman made peace with them, then he would                               soon become the most powerful and respected leader in the                               New World.                                      “Unfortunately, Cabeza de Vaca, it is not a simple                               matter,” said Governor Guzman.  “While you have been lost,                              many changes have taken place.  In a place called Peru,                               Francisco Pizarro has conquered the vast empire of the                               Incas—”                                      “How did he conquer them?” Alvar interrupted.                                      “It is not a story you will like, but his methods are very                              common.  He invited the Inca leaders to a banquet for                               peaceful negotiations.  When they arrived, his soldiers                               surrounded them with cannons and killed all of them except                               the emperor himself.  Pizarro held the emperor for ransom,                               and in exchange for his release, the Incas filled three large                              rooms, from ground to the ceiling, with gold and silver.  And                               that is not all.”                                      As Governor Guzman continued his report on the                               events of the past ten years, Alvar sat and sadly shook his                               head.  The Spaniards were not the only ones in the New                                                                  111","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               World.  The French, the Portuguese, and even the English                             were competing for claims and exploration rights throughout                             the New World.  There was a general rush to explore and                             conquer as quickly as possible.                                    “If you do not conquer these people, then somebody                            else will,” Alvar admitted.  “But I hope you will not use the                             same methods that Pizarro used.  If you must conquer, you                             should do so with love and sympathy, not with guns and                             slavery.”                                    “On that you have my word,” said Governor Guzman.                            “I hate the sight of blood.  I will send for Alcaraz and tell him                             to return with the rest of the savages—I mean natives—so that                             we can make a peace treaty.”                                    Days later, trumpets sounded when the lookouts saw                             Alcaraz’s flags on the horizon.  As the small army neared,                            Alvar could see hundreds of natives in chains.  Alvar ran to                             meet Alcaraz and pulled him from his horse to ground.                                    “You gave me your word!” Alvar shouted, losing                             control of his temper and punching Alcaraz in the face.                                    “I said I would not harm them, and you can see for                            yourself that those who did not resist are in good health,”                                                              112","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 replied Alcaraz, wiping blood from his chin.  “Good enough                               to work, anyway.”                                      “Governor Guzman, you cannot allow this.  We have                               lost the natives’ trust because of this man,” Alvar said, once                               again trying to get his hands around Alcaraz’s throat as other                              Conquistadors tried to hold him back.  “I have spent years                               living with them, learning their language, earning their                               friendship and trust.”                                      “Cabeza de Vaca, I will not deny the fact that you have                               done many unusual things,” said Governor Guzman, “but did                              you not admit to me that you were only doing what was                               necessary to survive?”                                      “At first, yes, but...”                                      “Now, I understand that you do not want the past ten                               years of your life to have been wasted.

This is why I want you to tell the Indians that                               they have a choice.

He repeated his usual healing chants.                            Governor Guzman, Captain Alcaraz, and all the Spaniards                             were surprised as the natives bowed their heads and listened to                             Alvar’s words.  Then two women approached Alvar dragging                             a body on a stretcher, which was covered with leaves and                             branches.  Alvar removed the branches and almost collapsed                            with grief when he saw that it was Little Son.                                    “He tried to fight the men with beards,” one of the                             women said.  “He said he was not afraid, and that if anything                             happened to him, you would be able to save him.”                                    Alvar touched the thick scar on the Little Son’s chest                            and wept.  Beside the old arrowhead scar was the fresh wound                             of a musket ball.  “It seems that I only delayed your death                             when I healed you,” he whispered to the lifeless warrior.                             Then he stared deep into Captain Alcaraz’s eyes.  “You have                             killed a good man, and you have broken your word.”                                                     *      *      *                                                              114","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                          The natives considered Governor Guzman’s proposal                               and made their choice by the end of the day.  To prove their                               loyalty, they were commanded to begin building houses.                               Governor Guzman and Captain Alcaraz admitted that they                              were impressed by the manners of the natives, as well as their                               apparent willingness to become good citizens of Spain.  Once                               the houses were completed, the governor said that the people                               would be allowed to return and rebuild their homes under the                               conditions that they pay regular taxes in food and gold.                                     “Just don’t put them in chains,” Alvar said, knowing                               that there was little else that—as one man—he could do or                               say.                                      Alvar traveled to Mexico City, which was Spain’s                               major stronghold in the New World.  He hoped to convince                              the Spanish leaders to be more sympathetic.  Cortes no longer                               governed there, because his cruelty toward the native Aztecs                               was so terrible that even the courts of Spain were offended,                               and forced him to give up the governorship.                                                                     115","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      Alvar was greeted as a hero, for his reputation and                             stories of his adventures quickly spread through the New                             World.  He toured the ancient Aztec temples and palaces, but                             found that most had been re-furnished by Cortes.  He was                             given fine clothing, but he did not feel comfortable wearing it.                            At night, he slept on the wooden floor at the foot of a big, soft                             bed.  Even most of the Spanish food and spices no longer                             tasted good to him.  Other Spaniards were eager to hear his                             stories about the natives, but many seemed disappointed and                             surprised that Alvar had no tales of cannibalism or other                            savagery.                                    One evening, as he stared at his plate during a banquet                             in an ancient Aztec palace, Francisco Vásquez de Coronado                             introduced himself.  “I hear you tamed the wild Indians.  Is it                             true that the people there eat their children?”                                   “Of course not,” Alvar laughed.  “They love their                             children as much as any parents in the world.”                                    “Lazaro de Cardenas told me that there are cities made                             of gold, silver, pearls, and emeralds.”                                    “Nonsense,” Alvar continued laughing.  “It is true that                            there is a little gold here and there, but I think you will be                                                              116","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 disappointed if you go looking for it.

It is much greater than any of these materials.”                                      “And what do you plan to do about it, Cabeza de                               Vaca?”                                     “I will return to Spain and tell my story to the king.  He                               must know the truth about what is happening in this land, and                               that there is a better way to spread Spain’s greatness.”                                      “Well, the king is a very busy man,” Coronado                               laughed.  “While you are waiting in line to speak with him, I                              will be sitting on a mountain of gold.”                                      Alvar had heard enough.  No matter what the                               conversation was about, it always ended with gold.  He crept                               out of the Aztec palace without anyone noticing.  ‘I will go to                               the king and tell him my story,’ he told himself.  ‘Surely, a                              king will be wise enough to see past the gold and into the                                                                117","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               hearts of people.  Surely a king can understand that it is wrong                             to tear apart a culture, and that it is better to first learn the                             language and customs of the natives before trying to teach                             them ours.’                                    Alvar traveled over land to the coast.  He had no                            possessions, and he did not tell anyone he was leaving before                             he boarded a ship that would take him back to Spain.  It was                             nice to breathe in the ocean air and feel the waves once again.                             Alvar watched the sun set over the land where he had                             wandered, and his heart was flooded suddenly with memories                            and sadness for all the friends he had lost and was leaving                             behind.  He turned to the east and thought of Spain and all the                             things he wanted to say to the king.  “I will teach the world to                             conquer through gentleness and love,” he whispered.  For the                             first time in years, he looked to the future with hope.  He felt                            like a Conquistador again.                                                                           118","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                                             Epilogue                                          Cabeza de Vaca returned to Spain in 1537, ten years                               after departing with Narvaez.  He urged the king and high                              courts to be sympathetic toward the cultures and beliefs of the                               natives in the New World.  Though he was generally well                               received, his wishes were largely ignored.  Shortly thereafter,                               he was given an appointment as Governor of Río de la Plata,                               in present-day Paraguay.  In 1542, he led an expedition more                              than one thousand miles into Brazil, where he took a seat as                               Governor of Asuncíon.  His sympathetic position towards the                               natives angered the Spanish settlers under his governance, and                               he was forced to leave after a rebellion in 1544.                                      He was placed under arrest and returned to Spain.  The                              details of his trial are not clear, though it can be assumed that                               his policies offered too much freedom to the natives.  As a                               result, he was banished to Africa.  Though he received a                               pardon in 1556, the date and whereabouts of his death are not                               known.  It is believed that he died a poor man in 1557.                                                              119","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      Cabeza de Vaca’s personal account of his adventure,                             called Relación, was first published in 1542.  Cabeza de                             Vaca’s story of the Zuñi people in the American Southwest                             inspired Franciso de Coronado to search for the mythical                             ‘Seven Cities of Cibole,’ believing that he would find masses                            of gold.  Coronado found no riches, and his expedition met                             with disaster.  The ‘Seven Cities of Cibole’ turned out to be                             little more than a handful of poor, drought-stricken villages                             and hungry people, exactly as Alvar had described.
