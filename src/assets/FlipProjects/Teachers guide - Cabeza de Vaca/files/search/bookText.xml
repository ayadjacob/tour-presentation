                                 The Age of Exploration started in the 1400s. Europeans were trying to find new
                                 trade routes to the Far East from where they imported silk and spices, valuable
                                 commodities at the time. Silk was used to make fine clothing and spices kept food
                                 from spoiling. Europeans had so far relied on the Silk Road, a long and dangerous
                                 route linking Europe with China. The rulers of Europe started to fund explorations
        to find new sea routes to Asia.


                                 Portugal was the first European country that sent explorers to search for new
                                 ways to reach China. However, other countries quickly followed and competition
                                 soon started between European neighbors. Christopher Columbus wanted to
                                 find a shortcut to China by sailing west. When Portugal refused to fund his trip,
                                 he went to the rulers of Spain, who gave him money. His discovery of a new
                                 continent on this now legendary trip brought glory to Spain. Other European
        countries such as France, England, and Holland later joined the competition to conquer new lands in the
        New World.

                      Who are some famous European explorers? What did they discover?
                      Italian-born Christopher Columbus sailed west from Spain in 1492 on an expedition funded
                      by the King and Queen of Spain. After a long and difficult journey, he arrived at the island
                      of Hispanola. Thinking he was near the coast of China, he named the Caribbean islands the
                      West Indies. Columbus claimed the new lands he discovered for Spain. He never reached
                      mainland North and South America, which were later discovered by a flurry of explorers
        who followed him to the New World.


                           Vasco Da Gama was a Portuguese explorer who sailed to India by going around Africa.
                           He was the first to cross an all-water sea route from Europe to India. In 1497, he sailed
                           from Portugal, crossed the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, and went on to India. It
                           took him ten months to complete his journey.



                           Ferdinand Magellan was another explorer from Portugal. Instead of heading east like
                           other explorers, Magellan decided to explore the possibility of reaching the Far East
                           by sailing west around South America. He left Spain in 1519 with nearly 250 men and
                           four ships. Three years later, only one ship returned carrying 18 men. Magellan was not
                           one of them. Although the trip cost him his life, Magellan became famous as the first
                           explorer who sailed across the world.




                                Great civilizations and empires thrived in the New World. Among them were
                                the Aztecs of present-day Mexico and the Incas of the country of Peru. These
                                two peoples led an advanced way of life which ended abruptly after they were
                                conquered by Europe. The Aztecs were formidable engineers. They built a
                                magnificent capital, Tenochtitlan, which was larger than any European city at
        the time. The Incas built a complex road system and created new agricultural methods including terraced
        farming.]]></page><page Index="6"><![CDATA[2

                        While Reading



                  Pronunciation
         *
         Pay particular attention to the following words:
        “conquistador” (kon-kwis-tuh-dawr, kong),
        “islands” (ahy-luh ndz), “vineyards” (vin-yerdz),
         “livestock” (lahyv-stok), and Spaniard (span-yerd).

                      Vocabulary
        Teaching Point: Style and Language
         Use knowledge of the meaning of individual
        words to predict the meaning of unknown
        compound words.
         Predict the meaning of the compound word
        port-city using your knowledge of the
        individual words.


         Each word can be broken down into two.
         Determine the definitions of the words in the
        compound then the meaning of the new word.

        Port means a harbor.
        City means a large town.
        A port-city therefore is a large town with a
        harbor.

        Teaching Point: Style and Language
         Determine the meaning of unfamiliar words
        using context clues.
         Without looking at their dictionaries, students
        should infer the meaning of “plantation” and
        “Conquistador” using context clues.

         Context clues are usually close to where the
        unfamiliar word appears. The meaning of a word
        can be guessed based on a direct definition, a
        synonym, or the general context of a sentence.

        Hint
         For plantation, infer the meaning from the
        general context.
         A plantation is a place where grapes and
        maybe other crops are grown, farm animals
        live, and slaves do the manual work.
        Therefore, it is a large farm or estate.
         For Conquistador, look for a direct definition.
         Explain the words in the dictionary,
        focusing on those in the vocabulary list, as
        they come up in the reading.

                                                                                                        A

        Hernando Cortes (1485-1587) was the
        Spanish explorer who became famous
        for leading the expedition that started the
        conquest of Mexico. He was part of the
        first generation of European explorers who
        began the colonization of the New World.
        The gold and riches that he discovered
        in the Aztec empire inspired many other
        explorers to follow his steps.
        In 1519, leading a small force, Cortes
        peacefully entered the Aztec capital of
        Tenochtitlan, rich in gold and other
        treasures. The Aztecs soon rebelled against
        the Spanish presence, but their revolt was
        brutally crushed. Cortes quickly became
        a hero in Spain because of the riches he
        sent home. As a reward, the king of Spain
        appointed Cortes governor of Mexico.
        However, the King became suspicious
        of Cortes’ ambitions and sent officials
        to Mexico to investigate his actions and
        ruthlessness toward the Natives. In 1528,
        Cortes was ordered to return to Spain. He
        was later sent back to Mexico but was
        never reappointed governor. He died in
        Spain in 1587.

                   Pronunciation

         Pay particular attention to the following
        words: “cooperate” (koh-op-uh-reyt),
        “horizon” (huh-rahy-zuh n), “chuckled”
        (chuhk-uh ld), and “shepherd” (shep-erd).

                      Grammar

        Use of the comparative
         “The men will be much happier when we
        reach Hispanola…”


         Happier is the comparative of the adjective
        happy.


         To get the comparative of an adjective that
        has two syllables and ends with y, we drop    A
        the y and add ier at the end.
         It should be pointed out to students to
        avoid saying more happy or more easy,
        which are common mistakes.


         Can you think of other examples to which
        this rule applies?


        Trendy → trendier
        Lovely → lovelier
        Friendly → friendlier
        Heavy → heavier

         Use knowledge of the meaning of individual
        words to predict the meaning of unknown
        compound words.
         Predict the meaning of the compound
        word “mainland” using your knowledge of
        the individual words.

         Main means principal or chief in size or
        importance. Land is the part of the earth’s

                      Vocabulary
        Teaching Point: Style and Language
         Use knowledge of the meaning of individual
        words to predict the meaning of unknown
        compound words.
         There are several compound words on
        pages12 and 13. Encourage students to
        find them, break them down and infer their
        meaning. Lookout, landmass, gangplank,
        marketplace.

        Teaching Point: Style and Language
        Prefixes

         Examine the word replenish. It starts with

        the prefix re. A prefix is a group of letters
        added to the beginning of a word to form a
        new word. The prefix re means again. So
        replenish means to fill up on new supplies;
        it is a repeated action.

         Explain the words in the dictionary,
        focusing on those in the vocabulary list, as
        they come up in the reading.






                   Teaching Point: Vocabulary List

                      History
         The Horse and the Conquest
                of the New World



        The Natives did not have horses. They
        had never seen this animal until the
        Conquistadors brought it to the New
        World in the 16th century. The trip across
        the Atlantic was not always easy for
        horses. They were the first to suffer when
        water and food supplies were low on the
        ships. Some were tossed overboard.
        The Conquistadors quickly established
        farms in the New World to breed horses
        that they used during their conquest
        wars. When the Natives first saw the
        bearded Spaniards wearing helmets and
        breastplates and riding horses, they were
        frightened to death.
        The horse was later adopted by many
        tribes and became an important part of
        their culture.

        Idiom
         Identify the expression “like the back of
        my hand” and explain its meaning.
         It means to know something very well and
        understand it perfectly. This idiom comes
        from the assumption that people know
        what their hand is like very well.

        focusing on those in the vocabulary list, as
        they come up in the reading.

                     While Reading



                   Pronunciation
         Pay particular attention to the following
        words: “navigator” (nav-i-gey-ter),
        “anchors” (ang-kerz), “churn” (churn),
        furiously (fyoo r-ee-uh s-lee), and
        “rugged” (ruhg-id).
                      Vocabulary

        Teaching Point: Style and Language
         Use knowledge of the meaning of individual
        words to predict the meaning of unknown
        compound words.
         Predict the meaning of the compound
        words “overhear” and “warehouse” using
        your knowledge of the individual words.
        Over+hear = Overhear
        Ware+house= Warehouse

         “Ware” is the only word that may be
        unfamiliar to students in the above
        compounds. Point out that it is usually
        used in the plural form “wares” which
        means goods.

        Teaching Point: Style and Language
        Prefixes
         Identify the prefix in “uncharted” and
        explain how it affects the meaning of the
        word.
         The prefix un- means not. Therefore
        uncharted means something that has no
        charts or maps and has not been explored.


         Explain the words in the dictionary,
        focusing on those in the vocabulary list, as
        they come up in the reading.

                                              The storm that the
        Independent activity                  expedition ran into is
                  Hurricanes                  a hurricane, which

                                              is a type of tropical
        storm that forms over the Atlantic or eastern Pacific. This
        rotating storm, with winds over 74 miles (119 km) per
        hour is also called a typhoon in the western Pacific, and a
        cyclone in the Indian Ocean.

         Students can research this topic online and bring in
        information to share with the class. Some interesting aspects
        to cover are:  What is a hurricane? How does it form?
         What damage can it inflict? How does one survive a
        hurricane? What are some famous hurricanes?

         The word hurricane came to English from  the Spanish
          huracan. Spanish explorers, who lost many ships to
         these violent winds, borrowed the word from the Taino
         Indians of the Caribbean. According to some accounts,
         the word was used by the natives to refer to evil spirits
                      and weather gods.]]></page><page Index="28"><![CDATA[24

                   Pronunciation
         Pay particular attention to the following
        words: “loaned” (lohnd), “shoals”
        (shohlz), “unpredictable” (uhn-pri-dik-
        tuh-buhl), “battered” (bat-erd), and
        “motionless” (moh-shuh n-lis).                A

        Teaching Point: Style and Language
        Idiom
         Identify the expression “grind to a stop”

        and explain its meaning.
         To grind means to move with difficulty
        because of friction. Grind to a stop is to be
        forced to stop due to an external factor.

        Teaching Point: Style and Language
         Determine the meaning of unfamiliar words    B
        using context clues.
         Without looking at their dictionaries,
        students should infer the meaning of
        “shoals” using context clues.


        Hint
         Find a synonym in the sentence. The
        synonym, sandbar, is a compound word.
        If students are unfamiliar with the word
        ask them to break it down and infer the
        meaning.
        Sand+bar = Sandbar
         A sandbar is a bar of sand formed in a
        river or along a shore by the action of
        waves.

                   Pronunciation

         Pay particular attention to the following
        words: “stomach” (stuhm-uh k), “shards”
        (shahrdz), “crossbows” (kraws-bohz,
        kros), “handkerchief” (hang-ker-chif,
        cheef) and “spittle” (spit-l).
                      Vocabulary

        Teaching Point: Style and Language
        Prefixes
        Examine the word "re-sharpened." It starts
        with the prefix re. A prefix is a group of
        letters added at the beginning of a base
        word to create a new word.  The prefix
        re means again. Therefore, to re-sharpen      A
        means to sharpen again.


        Teaching Point: Style and Language
        Idiom
         Identify the expressions “his jaw dropped”
        and “at the top of his lungs” and explain
        their meaning.
         “His jaw dropped” means he was very
        surprised and “at the top of his lungs”
        means very loud, with the highest capacity
        that his lungs can give.


         Explain the words in the dictionary,
        focusing on those in the vocabulary list, as
        they come up in the reading.

                     Vocabulary
        Teaching Point: Style and Language
        Suffixes
         A suffix is a group of letters added to
        the end of a word to form a new one. It
        usually changes the grammatical function
        of the word. Examine the word countless.
        It ends with the suffix -less which means
        without. This suffix changes a noun to an
        adjective.
        Fear+less = Fearless



         Do you know any other adjectives that end
        with the suffix less?

         The suffix -full has the opposite effect. It
        means full of. Note that it is spelled with
        only one l, whereas the word full has two.
        The suffix –full also changes a noun to an
        adjective.
        Pain + ful = Painful
         Give other examples of adjectives ending
        with ful.

                      Vocabulary


        Teaching Point: Word Origin
         Maize, which means corn, came to English
        from the Spanish word maíz. The Spanish
        borrowed the word from the Taino
        Indians, the indigenous tribe of Hispaniola,
                                                                                                         1
        who referred to the plant as mahiz. Maize
        is a type of cereal which is indigenous to
        the Americas, where the natives taught
        European settlers how to grow it. It was
        Christopher Columbus who introduced
        it to Europe, where is it known as Indian
        corn, in reference to its origin.

        pronounced the same way but have                                                                    A
        different meanings and are spelled
        differently.

        Mourning and morning
         The first word means to grieve a dead
        person and is spelled with ou. The second
        means the first part of the day and is
        spelled with an o.

         The English language is full of
        homophones. That is why it is important
        to think about the meaning of a word in
        context to make sure you spell it correctly.

        Teaching Point: Style and Language
         Use knowledge of the meaning of individual
       words to predict the meaning of unknown
       compound words.
         Determine the meaning of unfamiliar words
        using context clues.
         Without looking at their dictionaries,
        students should infer the meaning of
        “lifestyle” using context clues.


         Lifestyle is a compound word life+style.
        By looking at the individual words you
        can infer the meaning, which is the way
        people live their lives.

         Another way is by looking for a context
        clue, which in this case is the synonym,
        customs.

         Prickly pears are the fruit that grows on
        cactus trees. They are shaped like pears
        and covered with prickles. That’s how
        they acquired their name. The tree is
        said to have originated in the American
        southwest and Mexico, but was later
        introduced by European explorers to other
        regions with tropical climates. The fruit
        comes in a variety of colors including
        white, yellow or reddish purple.

         Pay particular attention to the following
        words: “horseshoe” (hawrs-shoo, hawrsh-),
        “spear” (speer), and zuñi (zoo-nee, zoon-
        yee).

         Teaching Point: Style and Language
         Identify style of English used in the passage
         The natives told Alvar that the horses wore
        horseshoes on their “feet.” Do horses have
        feet? What is the correct word he should
        have used? Why did the author make this
        deliberate error?


         Horses have hooves (plural of hoof), not                                                           A
        feet. The author used the term feet to make
        the conversation more realistic. When
        people speak, they don’t always use exact
        terms and they often make grammatical
        mistakes. When writing dialogues, authors
        write the same way we speak.

       Determine the meaning of unfamiliar
       words using context clues.

        Use context clues to infer the meaning of

        Hint
        By looking at the context of the sentence

        made of emeralds that were offered to him by the tribesmen.

        Coronado came to explore the legendary Seven Cities of Cibola
        of New Mexico and Arizona. They had acquired the name of
        Seven Cities of Gold because they were believed to have invaluable
        treasures. To his great disappointment, he found nothing but Zuñi villages.]]></page><page Index="98"><![CDATA[94

          Teaching Point: Style and Language
         Define and identify onomatopoeia.
         Onomatopoeia is the use of words that
        imitate the sounds of objects or actions
        that they refer to. The sounds suggest the
        meaning of the words.


           The verb whinny comes from the sound
        that the horse makes. We call this
        onomatopoeia. Many words related to
        animals are onomatopoeic. For instance
                                                      B
        we say a cat “meows,” a frog “croaks,” a
        lion “roars,” a bird “tweets.”
         There are also other onomatopoeia that
        imitate sounds such as “bang,” “crash,”
        “whistle,” and “tick-tock.”

        Teaching Point: Style and Language
        Word Origin
         The word banquet comes from French
        where it means a small bench. Originally,
        a banquet was a snack eaten on a bench.
        The meaning was later totally reversed to
        mean a grandiose feast.
