Multiplication and Division of Whole Numbers                     Represent contextual situations as multiplication or division problems                        Classify a contextual situation as requiring multiplication or division.                        Write a situation that can be solved by a given multiplication/division                         statement.                        Solve a real-life situation using multiplication or division.                    Example                    Many situations require division to solve the problem. Which of the following can                   be interpreted as a division problem? If it is, solve it. If not, explain why.                   a. Irene bought 5 pounds of pistachios. She paid $6 for each pound. How much                      did Irene pay?                      This is not a division problem. Actually, this is a multiplication problem as you                      are finding the total cost for multiple identical items.                    b. Melinda wants to cut a rope of length 24 inches into three equal parts. How long                      is each part?

Each part is 24  3 = 8 inches long.                    c. Nancy planted 4 rows of trees. She                     planted 6 trees in each row. How many                     trees did she plant?                      This is not a division problem. Actually, this                     is a multiplication problem as the same                     number of trees is repeated in multiple                     rows and you must find the total.                    d.

The apples are to be divided into 8 equal parts.                      Each child receives 48  8 = 6 apples.

Example                a. Mr. Foxx works at an auto dealership. He wants to arrange 36 cars in rows with                   the same number of cars in each row. If he puts 9 cars in each row, how many                   rows will he use?                     Since 9  4 = 36 there will be 4 rows of cars.                            b. The manager of the dealership does not like the arrangement Mr. Foxx uses.                   Describe another way the 36 cars can be arranged in rows with an equal                   number of cars in each row.                    36 can be expressed as 6  6. Another way to arrange the 36 cars is to have 6                   rows with 6 cars in each row.                  c. The owner of the dealership likes multiples of 10. He asks the manager to                   arranged the 36 cars in 10 rows with an equal number of cars in each row.                   Explain why this cannot be accomplished.                    36 = 10 + 10 + 10 + 6                   When splitting 36 into groups of 10, there will be 6 cars left. Thus, it is not                   possible to arrange the 36 cars in rows with 10 cars in each row.                           6                                                                ACE CCSS GRADE 3","Questions (Multiple choice)                   1.
