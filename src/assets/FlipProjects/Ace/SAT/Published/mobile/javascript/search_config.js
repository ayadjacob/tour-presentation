HA.1.1 Create a linear expression in one variable to represent a context                  Illustration                  The lowest acceptable iron level in the blood of an average person is 60 micrograms per                  deciliter. Anna suffers from iron deficiency with an iron level of 15 micrograms per                  deciliter. She is on a dietary treatment plan that combines food supplements and iron                  rich meals. Anna expects her iron level to increase by 5 micrograms per deciliter each                  week. Which of the following represents Anna’s blood iron level in micrograms per                  deciliter after n weeks of treatment?                  A. 5 + 15n          B. 60 + 15n           C. 60 + 5n           D. 15 + 5n                  Answer key                  Choice (D) is correct. If the iron level in Anna’s blood increases by 5 µg/dL                  (micrograms per deciliter) each week, then after n weeks, this level would increase by                  5n µg/dL. At this time, the iron level will be equal to its original value plus the total                  increase, and this is given by the expression 15 + 5n.                  Alternatively, one may verify the choices using the fact that the correct answer should                  show an iron level with initial value 15 µg/dL and increasing at a rate of 5 (µg/dL) each                  week. Choice (A) is incorrect because the initial value of the expression when                  n = 0 is 15 and not 5, and the rate of increase per week is 5 and not 15. Choices (B) and                  (C) are incorrect because 60 is the acceptable level and not the initial value of the iron                  level in Anna’s blood. Choice (D) shows the proper initial value of 15 and rate of 5.                 Select the correct answer.                  1. A giant Gippsland earthworm averages     3.

Answer key                    Choice (C) is the correct answer. The value of |x – 1| is positive when x ≠ 1 and is equal to                    0 when x = 1. Therefore, 1 + |x – 1| is greater than 1 when x ≠ 1 and is equal to 1 when                    x = 1. This description matches choice (C), which is the correct choice.

If 2 beef casserole meals and 4 Chinese chicken salads have a                    total of 2,440 calories, what is the combined number of calories in one beef casserole                    meal and one Chinese chicken salad?                    Answer key                    The correct answer is 920. If x is the number of calories in one salad, then the number of                    calories in one beef meal is x + 320. The number of calories in 2 beef meals and 4                    salads is 2(x + 320) + 4x, and this should be equal to 2,440. Therefore, the equation                    2(x + 320) + 4x = 2,440 has to be satisfied. Expanding the left side, we get                    2x + 640 + 4x = 2,440. After grouping the x-terms on the left side and subtracting 640                    from both sides, we get 6x = 1800, or x = 300. The combined number of calories in one                    beef meal and one salad equals (x + 320) + x = 620 + 300 = 920.

The given description translates to the equation 12 + 6x = 11 + 19,                 which simplifies to 12 + 6x = 30, or, 6x = 18 after subtracting 12 from both sides. Noting                 that 12x = 2(6x), we may obtain the answer by multiplying both sides of the equation                 6x = 18 by 2, which gives 2(6x) = 2 × 18, or 12x = 36.                 Choice (A) is incorrect. If 12x = 48, then 6x = 24 and 12 + 6x = 12 + 24 = 36 ≠ 11 + 19.                 Choice (C) is incorrect. If 12x = 24, then 6x = 12 and 12 + 6x = 12 + 12 = 24 ≠ 11 + 19.                 Choice (D) is incorrect. If 12x = 3, then 6x = 1.5 and 12 + 6x = 12 + 1.5 = 13.5 ≠ 11 + 19.

Noting that 6x in the expression to evaluate is twice the term                 3x in the given equation, we realize that a good strategy is to solve the equation for 3x.                 Subtracting 4 from both sides gives 3x = 2. Now, we evaluate the expression                 6x + 1 = 2(3x) + 1 = 2(2) + 1 = 5.                 Alternatively, one may solve the given equation for x, and substitute in the expression.                                                               2                 Since 3x = 2, as concluded above, we have x =   .
