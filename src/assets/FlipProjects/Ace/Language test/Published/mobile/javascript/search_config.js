A small number of names can be for men and women, but these are                         not very common. Sometimes a name can be for men and women, but the spelling                         might be different, e.g. Francis is a man’s name, and Frances is a woman’s name—                         the names sound the same, but the spelling is different.                      •  Some men’s and women’s names can sound similar, e.g. John (a man’s name) and                         Joan (a woman’s name), so you have to listen carefully to names.                      •  In IELTS™, it can be helpful to know common English names.
