This port-city had                               special meaning for Alvar because his grandfather had                               conquered these same islands for Spain forty years before.                               His grandfather had brought back many amazing stories and                               treasures from his adventures.  Also, his grandfather had                              brought back several slaves who were native to the Canary                               Islands.  These people were lean and muscular, with bronze-                               colored skin.  They picked grapes in the vineyards and tended                               the livestock on Alvar’s grandfather’s plantation.  As a boy,                               Alvar used to imagine the strange land from which these                              slaves were taken.  Now he saw the Canary Islands with his                               own eyes, and understood what had inspired his grandfather to                               claim them for Spain so many years ago.                                      Like his grandfather and all the other men on his ship,                               Alvar was a Conquistador: a Spaniard who sailed to all known                              corners of the globe in search of riches and new lands to                               claim.  Just thirty-five years had passed since Christopher                                                                3","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               Columbus first set foot in what Europeans called the New                             World.  Eager explorers from Europe quickly set sail for the                             New World, hoping to discover gold, spices, and other riches.                             Alvar was a one-year-old when Columbus set sail.  By the                             time Alvar was ten, his head was filled with stories about the                            distant New World with all its mysteries: cities of gold, tribes                             of cannibals, exotic animals, and fields of spice.  As he grew,                             he dreamed of joining the Conquistadors.  Now, at the age of                             thirty-six, his dream was close to coming true.  He was not in                             the New World yet, but being in the Canary Islands meant that                            he was getting closer.                                    Alvar was part of a mighty expedition, of five ships                             and over six hundred men.  The expedition’s leader was                             Governor Panfilo de Narvaez.  When they had set sail from                             Sanlucar, Spain—the same port from which Columbus had set                            sail—thousands of people had gathered to wish them good                             luck.  The crews of all five ships sent out a great cheer, and                             their high spirits continued as they traveled south.                                    The Canary Islands were the last stop before an                             expedition set off on the journey across the Atlantic Ocean.                            This was the last dry land the Conquistadors would see for                                                               4","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 months.  It was a chance for them to fill their storage                               compartments with fresh water, citrus fruits, and other                               supplies.                                      Later that day, after the ships were docked, Alvar went                               to lunch with Alonso Castillo, one of the captains of the five                              ships.  This was the first chance that the two men had had to                               sit down and talk.  Together, they enjoyed a meal of fresh                               peaches and bananas.                                      “So, Señor Cabeza de Vaca, are you excited about                               going to the New World?” asked Captain Castillo.                                     “Of course.  Who wouldn’t be?  And please, you may                               call me Alvar.”                                      “And you may call me Alonso,” the captain said.  “I                               hope our voyage is as successful as that of Hernan Cortes.”                                      “Cortes…” Alvar said, wiping peach juice from his                              beard.  “That is a name you must use with caution when                               Governor Narvaez is around.”                                      “What do you mean?” asked Alonso.  Hernan Cortes                               was a hero to every Spaniard.  Just a few years before, Cortes                               had swept through Mexico, conquered the ancient Aztec city                                                                   5","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               of Tenochtitlan, and filled Spain’s treasury with gold.  His                             achievements made him a living legend.                                    “While Cortes was setting up his government in                             Mexico,” Alvar explained, “some of the other                             Conquistadors—and even the king—began to wonder whether                            Cortes was getting a little too hungry for power.  Cortes’                             former commander in Cuba sent a small army to put Cortes in                             his place, and to remind him that King Charles was still in                             charge.”                                    Captain Castillo nodded.  He had heard rumors about                            this, but Cortes was so popular that most Spaniards did not                             pay attention to any negative stories about him.                                    “But did you know,” Alvar continued, “that our own                             Governor Narvaez led that army to overthrow Cortes?  When                             Narvaez arrived in Mexico, however, Cortes stole into his                            camp at night with a small group of his own men, captured                             Narvaez, and convinced Narvaez’s army to join him instead.                             Our good governor was sent back to Cuba, and eventually to                             Spain, with his tail between his legs like a scared dog.”                                                                    6","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                        Captain Castillo was very surprised.  “I wonder why I                               never heard about this.”                                      “It is not something that the governor likes to talk                               about,” said Alvar.  “It damaged the governor’s reputation,                               and because of this, he had trouble raising money for our                              expedition.  In fact, almost all of the money for these ships                               and supplies came out of Narvaez’s own pocket.  He has his                               entire life’s savings invested in this journey.”                                      “Well, once we arrive in Florida, Governor Narvaez’s                               reputation will be fixed.  I have heard that the treasure in                              Florida is ten times greater than all of the gold in Mexico.”                                      “This may be true,” Alvar warned.  “But we should                               hope that the governor’s desire to outdo Cortes does not hurt                               his judgment.  After all, we are going somewhere that no                               Spaniard has ever been.  There is no way of knowing what                              danger awaits us in Florida.”                                      “You are right to be careful, Alvar, but it is bad luck to                               question our leader at the beginning of the expedition.  We                               should believe in his judgment,” Castillo said, passing a plate                               of honey-covered bananas.                                                                   7","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                      “I do hope they load the cargo bay with some of these                             bananas,” Alvar said, changing the subject.  “It will be a long                             time before we see fresh fruit again.”                                    “Just to be sure, I am going to buy a crate of them for                             myself.”                                                       *      *      *                                       Alvar stood on the deck of the ship watching the sunset                             with Governor Narvaez.  It was the middle of August 1527,                             and more than two months had passed since they left the                            Canary Islands.  The voyage across the Atlantic was taking                             longer than expected because of light winds and bad weather.                             Supplies were beginning to run low.                                    “The men will be much happier when we reach                             Hispañola, Governor,” said Alvar.  “Once they have rested on                            land for a while, they will be more excited about continuing                             on to Florida.”                                    “If only the wind would cooperate as it did the last time                             I made this trip,” said Narvaez, staring at the horizon.  “But I                                                                8","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 can wait.  The more we suffer now, the greater our rewards                               will be when we finally reach Florida.”                                      Then the governor grasped Alvar’s shoulder, and began                               laughing.  “My loyal friend, Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca,”                               he chuckled, “How did you get a name that means ‘Cow’s                              Head’?”                                      The governor’s remark did not anger Alvar.  From the                               time he was a boy, dreaming of sailing the high seas, his                               classmates were making fun of his name.  “Actually,                               Governor,” Alvar said proudly, “the name was given to my                              family by the king after the Battle of Toledo.  Because of—”                                      “Ah, the great battle on the plains of Toledo,” the                               governor interrupted.  “My ancestors fought there as well.                               Because of that victory two hundred and fifty years ago, we                               are no longer slaves to the Moors!  But why would a king give                              such a funny name to your family?”                                      “A shepherd on my mother’s side of the family knew                               of an unguarded pass through the mountains,” Alvar                               continued after the governor was finished interrupting.  “The                               armies of the kings used this path to launch a surprise attack                              on the Moors.   He marked the path with a cow’s skull.                                                                 9","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               Without this shepherd’s help, the Spanish never would have                             won.”                                    “Is that so?” the governor responded, but Alvar was not                             sure that Narvaez had really been listening.  “Look at the                             golden sunset.  That is what awaits us, Cabeza de Vaca... more                            gold than the light of the sun itself.  Years from now, your                             great-grandchildren will be called ‘Cabeza de Oro,’ – ‘Head                             of Gold’ - in your honor,” Narvaez laughed.  “Cortes himself                             will be begging at our door when he hears of our treasure and                             the land we have conquered.”                                   “Yes, but there is a lot of work to be done before we                             can boast,” said Alvar.                                    “Of course,” agreed Narvaez.  “We must get supplies                             and horses in Hispañola.  Then we must build a settlement in                             Florida.  But I do not think of it as work, Cabeza de Vaca.  I                            see it as adventure, and soon we will have a new land in the                             name of good King Charles.”                                    “Long live the king, and Spain’s glory!” said Alvar, as                             the sun disappeared below the sea.                                    During the sea voyage, they ran low on food, they were                            always tired, and usually sick.  Plus, the sailors were often                                                               10","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                                 bored.  If there was no wind, then there was nothing for them                               to do but scrub the decks, play dominoes, and polish their                               swords.  They tried to ignore their thirst and the hot sun.  Even                               the most experienced sailors were worn out after a month.  By                               the end of the second month, many of them were feeling                              cramped and crazy.  A sailor had to look at the same faces on                               the ship every day.  He got tired of hearing the same old war                               stories and complaints about hunger and thirst.                                      To make himself feel better, Alvar thought about his                               grandfather and all the other Conquistadors who had claimed                              so much land and gold for Spain.  Columbus was the first to                               cross from mainland Europe to the Americas.  A few years                               later, Ferdinand Magellan proved that the world was round                               because the great oceans were all connected.  Hernan Cortes                               and many others soon followed.  They began carving up the                              New World as if it were a roasted turkey.  These explorers and                               Conquistadors had all suffered during their voyages across the                               Atlantic, just like Alvar and the rest of his expedition.                                      But soon the journey would be over.  ‘I can make it                               through this,’ Alvar thought to himself.  ‘If they could do it,                              then so can I.  Like Governor Narvaez said, the more we                                                                11","C a b e z a   d e   V a c a                               suffer now, the greater our rewards will be in Florida.  We                             will build a rich colony and explore new land.’                                    After these happy thoughts, Alvar fell asleep and rested                             better than he had in months.                                    In the morning, Alvar was suddenly awakened by the                            sounds of shouting and the stamping of feet on the decks                             above.  He dressed quickly and ran to see what the excitement                             was all about.                                    On deck, the whole crew was gathered, waving flags                             and shouting out to the other four ships of the expedition.                            Way up high on the tallest mast, he saw the lookout, named                             Lope de Oviedo, pointing west and laughing with joy.                             Straining his eyes, Alvar was able to make out a distant                             landmass, rising from the sea like a thin haze.                                    “Do you think it is Hispañola, Governor?” Alvar asked.                                   “No doubt about it,” replied Governor Narvaez.  “It is                             just as I remember it on my first journey to the New World.”                                                      *      *      *                                      Santo Domingo, on the island of Hispañola, was the                            first European settlement in the New World.  When Alvar                                                               12"];
