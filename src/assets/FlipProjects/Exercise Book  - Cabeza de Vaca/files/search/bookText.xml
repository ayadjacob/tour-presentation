                                          The Age of Exploration


                  When did the Age of Exploration begin and why?

                                                         The Age of Exploration started in the 1400s.
                                                         Europeans were trying to find new trade routes
                                                         to the Far East from where they imported silk
                                                         and spices, valuable commodities at the time.
                                                         Silk was used to make fine clothing and spices
                                                         kept food from spoiling. Europeans had so far
                                                         relied on the Silk Road, a long and dangerous
                                                         route linking Europe with China. The rulers of
                  Europe started to fund explorations to find new sea routes to Asia.

                  Which countries were involved in the exploration?

                                                         Portugal  was  the  first  European  country  that
                                                         sent explorers to search for new ways to reach
                                                         China.  However,  other  countries  quickly
                                                         followed  and  competition  soon  started
                                                         between  European  neighbors.  Christopher
                                                         Columbus wanted to find a shortcut to China
                                                         by sailing west. When Portugal refused to fund
                                                         his  trip,  he  went  to  the  rulers  of  Spain,  who
                                                         gave  him  money.  His  discovery  of  a  new
                  continent  on  this  now  legendary  trip  brought  glory  to  Spain.  Other  European
                  countries  such  as  France,  England,  and  Holland  later  joined  the  competition  to
                  conquer new lands in the New World.

                  Who are the most famous European explorers? What did they discover?

                                                         Italian-born Christopher Columbus sailed west
                                                         from Spain in 1492 on an expedition funded by
                                                         the king and queen of Spain. After a long and
                                                         difficult  journey,  he  arrived  at  the  island  of
                                                         Hispañola. Thinking he was near the coast of
                                                         China,  he  named  the  Caribbean  islands  the
                                                         West Indies. Columbus claimed the new lands
                                                         he  discovered  for  Spain.  He  never  reached
                                                         mainland  North  and  South  America,  which
                                                         were later discovered by a flurry of explorers
                                                         who followed him to the New World.

                                   Vasco Da Gama was a Portuguese explorer who sailed to India
                                   by going around Africa. He was the first to navigate a sea-route
                                   from Europe to India. In 1497, he sailed from Portugal, rounded
                                   the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, and went on to India. It
                                   took ten months to complete his journey.




                                   Ferdinand Magellan was another explorer from Portugal. Instead
                                   of heading east like other explorers, Magellan tried to reach the
                                   Far East by sailing west around South America. He left Spain in
                                   1519 with nearly 250 men and four ships. Three years later, only
                                   one  ship  returned  carrying  18  men.  Magellan  was  not  one  of
                                   them.  Although  the  trip  cost  him  his  life,  Magellan  became
                                   famous as the first explorer to sail around the world.

               Which civilizations lived in the New World?

                                                     Great  civilizations  and  empires  thrived  in  the
                                                     New  World.  Among  them  were  the  Aztecs  of
                                                     present-day  Mexico  and  the  Incas  of  the
                                                     country  of  Peru.  These  two  peoples  led  an
                                                     advanced  way  of  life  which  ended  abruptly
                                                     after  they  were  conquered  by  Europe.  The
                                                     Aztecs were formidable engineers. They built a
                                                     magnificent  capital,  Tenochtitlan,  which  was
               larger than any European city at the time. The Incas built a complex road system
               and created new agricultural methods including terraced farming.

                  History

                  Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca (1490-1557) was a Spanish explorer well-known for
                  the years he spent living with the Natives in the American southwest.
                  He was born into a noble family and most of his ancestors were warriors. His name,
                  Cabeza de Vaca, translates into "Head of a Cow." The Spanish king gave the title to
                  one of Cabeza de Vaca’s ancestors after he helped Spain win a battle by marking a
                  difficult trail with cow skulls. Cabeza de Vaca also distinguished himself as a fine
                  officer in the king’s army.
                  In 1527, he was appointed Treasurer of the Panfilo de Narvaez expedition and sailed
                  to America looking for riches. The expedition ran into many difficulties, including
                  storms,  attacks  by  the  natives,  and  starvation.  After  a  shipwreck  on  the  Isle  of
                  Misfortune, off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, he spent nearly ten  years living
                  with Native American tribes. At first, he was treated as a slave but then he acquired
                  skills as a trader and healer, giving him a special status among the tribes. He spent
                  many years alone among the Natives before meeting up with four other survivors of
                  the expedition. The group then ran into Spanish soldiers stationed near Culiacàn,
                  Mexico, from where they made their way back to Spain.
                  Cabeza  de  Vaca  later  wrote  a  chronicle  about  his  adventures  in  the  New  World
                  called Relaciòn. This enlightened account, in which he appeals for better treatment
                  of the Natives, is considered the earliest description of the Native American way of
                  life before it was destroyed by colonization. He describes the customs and traditions
                  of dozens of tribes which have since been wiped out. Upon his return to Spain, he
                  was appointed Governor of Rio de la Plata in South America.
                  However, he soon fell out of favor with the king because of his sympathetic views
                  toward the Natives. He was banished to Africa, but is believed to have returned to
                  Spain where he died in 1557.

                  Biography
                  Hernando Cortes (page 5)

                  Hernando Cortes  (1485-1587)  was the Spanish explorer who became famous for
                  leading the expedition that started the conquest of Mexico. He was part of the first
                  generation of European explorers who began the colonization of the New World.
                  The  gold  and  riches  that  he  discovered  in  the  Aztec  empire  inspired  many  other
                  explorers to follow his steps.
                  In  1519,  leading  a  small  force,  Cortes  peacefully  entered  the  Aztec  capital  of
                  Tenochtitlan, rich in gold and other treasures. The Aztecs soon rebelled against the
                  Spanish presence, but their revolt was brutally crushed. Cortes quickly became a
                  hero in Spain because of the riches he sent home. As a reward, the king of Spain
                  appointed  Cortes  governor  of  Mexico.  However,  the  king  became  suspicious  of
                  Cortes’  ambitions  and  sent  officials  to  Mexico  to  investigate  his  actions  and
                  ruthlessness toward the Natives. In 1528, Cortes was ordered to return to Spain. He
                  was  later  sent  back  to  Mexico  but  was  never  reappointed  governor.  He  died  in
                  Spain in 1587.

                      1.  Which civilization in the New World did Cortes encounter in his conquests?



                      2.  Why did other explorers want to follow in his footsteps?



                      3.  How did Cortes and his men treat the Aztecs?

                  Hispañola (page 13)

                  In  1492,  Christopher  Columbus  discovered  the  island  of  Hispañola,  the  second
                  largest in the Caribbean, on his voyage to the New World. It was inhabited by a
                  group of Taino Indians who were peaceful and friendly to Columbus and his crew.
                  In the following years, Europeans started establishing settlements on the island. The
                  most important colony was the city of Santo Domingo which was founded in 1496
                  by  Bartholomew  Columbus,  Christopher’s  brother.  The  island,  whose  Taino
                  population  was  wiped  out  over  the  next  twenty-five  years,  became  a  base  for
                  explorers looking for new lands in the Caribbean and mainland America.
                  The island was later divided into two sides. One was controlled by the French and
                  the other by the Spanish. The French side is now known as Haiti and the Spanish
                  side has become the Dominican Republic.

                      1.  Which explorer discovered Hispañola? In what year?



                      2.  The Natives who lived on Hispañola were ___________:

               History
               The Horse and the Conquest of the New World (page 15)

               The  Natives  did  not  have  horses.  They  had  never  seen  this  animal  until  the
               Conquistadors brought it to the New World in the 16th century. The trip across the
               Atlantic was not always easy for horses. They were the first to suffer when water
               and food supplies were low on the ships. Some were tossed overboard.
               The Conquistadors quickly established farms in the New World to breed horses that
               they  used  during  their  conquest  wars.  When  the  Natives  first  saw  the  bearded
               Spaniards wearing helmets and breastplates and riding horses, they were frightened
               to death.
               The horse was later adopted by many tribes and became an important part of their
               culture.

                   1.  Who introduced the horse to America? When?




                   2.  Why were horses a necessity for Conquistadors?

                  Journal (page 22)

                  In this journal, you will make a list of Alvar’s character traits which will help you
                  complete the writing exercise at the end of the reader. Character traits describe a
                  person’s personality, feelings or thoughts.
                  In their writing, authors sometimes use exact words to describe a character. Other
                  times, they describe them through their actions, thoughts or feelings.


                  Read the following passage and answer the questions below.

                         “Señor Cabeza de Vaca,” one of the men shouted as a wave drenched the
                  canoe, “the master of the plantation insists that you come out of this awful weather
                  and join him for dinner.”

                         “Tell him ‘thank you,’ but that I am used to bad weather. Besides, I am
                  responsible for these ships and crews.”
                  “Please, señor, we have a horse for you on shore. You will be quite pleased with the
                  supplies we have to offer.”
                         Alvar could see that the men in the canoe were not going to give up, so he
                  decided to go along with them.  Alvar invited the other men on the ship, but they all

                  said ‘no,’ except Miruelo.

                      Why did Alvar hesitate before leaving his men on the boat?






                      What conclusions can you make about Alvar’s character based on his actions?

               Hurricanes (page 21)

               The storm that the expedition ran into was a hurricane, which is a type of tropical
               storm  that  forms  over  the  Atlantic  or  eastern  Pacific.  This  rotating  storm,  with
               winds  over  74  miles  (119km)  per  hour  is  also  called  a  typhoon  in  the  western
               Pacific, and a cyclone in the Indian Ocean.

               Research this topic online and bring in information to share with the class. Some
               interesting  aspects  to  cover  are:  What  is  a  hurricane?  How  does  it  form?  What
               damage can it inflict? How does one survive a hurricane? What are some famous
               hurricanes?

                         When the governor finished speaking, the village was totally quiet. Alvar

                  mosquito buzzed in his ear and he slapped at it, but missed.  Several other slaps
                  could be heard against faces and arms as insects of all kinds swarmed to the sweaty

                  army.
                         This was not what Alvar or anyone else had expected. It was so hot and
                  humid that his sweat seemed to seep through the armor that covered his head and
                  chest. It was not long before every man felt as though he was being watched.

               History
               The History of the Apalachee

                                                                                            th
               The Apalachee were an Indian tribe that was largely destroyed in the 18  century.
               The  tribe  lived  in  Northwest  Florida  at  Apalachee  Bay,  near  present-day
               Tallahassee.  Agriculture  and  trade  were  the  Apalachees’  main  activities.  The
               tribesmen  spoke  the  Muskogean  language,  which  does  not  exist  anymore.  The
               Apalachee  are  said  to  have  been  so  successful  that  mapmakers  named  the
               Appalachian mountain chain after them.
               In  the  16th  century,  the  Apalachee  came  into  contact  with  two  Spanish
               expeditionswhich were looking for gold. Those were the expeditions led by Narvaez
               and another explorer by the name of Hernando de Soto. The Apalachee, who feared
               and  hated  the  Spanish,  fought  back  with  raids  and  ambushes.  However,  in  the
               1600s, they were defeated.
               The real threat to the Apalachee came from the British and the native allies of the
               British.  In  1703,  the  Apalachee  suffered  a  devastating  defeat,  after  which  many
               were sold into slavery and others fled west to live in Louisiana.

                   1.  Who were the Apalachee?



                   2.  What happened to their tribe?



                   3.  What  happened  when  Spanish  explorers  crossed  into  Apalachee  territory
                      looking for gold?

               speak of Cortes as if you are in competition with him. You have ghosts chasing you,
               Governor Narvaez! With all due respect, sir, I only hope that you are making
               decisions based on what is best for the expedition, not for your reputation.”

                         At last, the landscape began to change. Alvar was thankful to see laurel trees

                  cedars were everywhere. The bushes and underbrush were softer and greener than

                  History
                  The Capoques (page 67)

                  The  Capoques,  also  known  as  Coaques  or  Cocos,  are  believed  to  have  been  a
                  branch  of  the  Karankawa  Indians  who  inhabited  the  Gulf  Coast  of  Texas.  The
                  Karankawa were poor nomadic people who traveled from one site to another to fish
                  and hunt for food. They divided themselves into smaller groups headed by a chief so
                  they could move around more easily.
                  Cabeza de Vaca’s encounter with this tribe in 1528 was the first recorded history of
                  the  Karankawa.  Over  the  next  three  hundred  years,  the  Karankawa  struggled
                  against French and Spanish colonization. Warfare and diseases introduced by the
                  Europeans  led  to  a  great  decrease  in  the  Karankawa  population.  In  1819,  they
                  suffered a major defeat in a battle against Jean Lafitte, the legendary pirate who
                  established  his  colony  on  Galvaston  Island.  However,    it  was  the  American
                  settlement of Texas that ultimately led to the tribe’s disappearance in the late 1850s.

                      1.  What larger tribe did the Capoques belong to?

                         [-A-] Coaques
                         [-B-] Cocos
                         [-C-] Cherokee
                         [-D-] Karankawa
                         [-E-] Apalachee

                      2.  How did the Karankawa live?



                      3.  Who was the first European to discover and write about the Karankawa?



                      4.  Identify and list the factors that weakened the Karankawa tribe.

               Read the passage and answer the questions below.

                      On the trading mat, Red Bird placed three deer hides and enough flint to
               make about one hundred arrowheads.  They also brought many of the dried reeds
               that were used as arrow shafts, but Alvar could see plainly that these were not
               uncommon in the area, and probably not worth much to the Avavares.
                      “As you know,” Alvar said, “the Capoques are at war and in great need of
               more arrows and animal hides. But for what you offer, I will gladly give you this

               many beads and shells.”  Alvar began placing many of the shells and beads back
               into his pack, because he did not think the Avavares were offering enough for his
               goods.

                   1.  Why did Alvar take back many of his beads and shells?



                   2.  How did Alvar know that the reeds were not valuable to the Avavares?

               History
               The Pueblo Indians (page 93)

               The Zuñi are a branch of the Pueblo Indians who were composed of several tribes
               living in the American southwest.
               They lived in permanent settlements which looked like apartment complexes. In his
               memoir,  La  Relacion,  Alvar  spoke  of  arrowheads  made  of  emeralds  that  were
               offered  to  him  by  the  tribesmen.  Inspired  by  Alvar’s  account,  Spanish  explorer
               Francisco de Coronado came to explore the legendary “Seven Cities of Cibola” of
               New  Mexico  and  Arizona.  They  had  acquired  the  name  “Seven  Cities  of  Gold”
               because  they  were  believed  to  have  invaluable  treasures.  To  his  great
               disappointment, he found nothing but Zuñi villages.





























                   1.  Who are the Zuñi?



                   2.  Why did Francisco Coronado believe that they lived in cities of gold?

                  History
                  Biography : Nuño Beltran de Guzman (page 107)

                  Nuño  Beltran  de  Guzman  (1490-1544)  is  a  Spanish  Conquistador  who  came  to
                  Mexico in 1526 when the country was still under Cortes’ military rule. In order to
                  bring  order  and  justice  to  the  colony,  the  king  of  Spain  appointed  de  Guzman
                  governor. Cortes was sent back to Spain and de Guzman took over with instructions
                  to treat the Natives fairly.
                  However, de Guzman’s behavior was no better than Cortes’. He set out to conquer
                  western  and  northern  regions  of  Mexico.  He  and  his  soldiers  attacked  the
                  inhabitants, stole their food, sold many into slavery, and tortured others to extract
                  information about the location of riches in their country. Between 1529 and 1536 de
                  Guzman  established  several  settlements  including  the  city  of  San  Miguel  de
                  Culiacàn and Guadalajara.
                  News  of  de  Guzman’s  cruelty,  which  earned  him  the  nickname  “bloody  de
                  Guzman,”  attracted  the  attention  of  the  first  Archbishop  of  Mexico,  Juan  de
                  Zumarraga. He arrested de Guzman in 1536 and shipped him back to Spain, where
                  he died in prison.

                      1.  What  was  de  Guzman’s  mission  when  he  was  appointed  governor  of
                         Mexico?

                  Moral

                  A moral is a lesson taught in a story. To find the moral one must look for the lesson
                  that the main character has learned at the end of the story.

                      1.  What is the moral of Cabeza de Vaca?






                      2.  Can we say that this moral is also the theme of Cabeza de Vaca? Why?



                  Journal (page 118)

                  Read the passage below and answer the questions.

                         Alvar  watched  the  sun  set  over  the  land  where  he  had  wandered,  and  his
                  heart was flooded suddenly with memories and sadness for all the friends he had
                  lost and was leaving behind.  He turned to the east and thought of Spain and all the
                  things he wanted to say to the king.   “I will teach the world to conquer through
                  gentleness and love,” he whispered.  For the first time in years, he looked to the
                  future with hope.  He felt like a Conquistador again.

                      1.  Alvar  has  gone  full  circle.  He  now  feels  like  a  Conquistador  again  after
                         having  abandoned  that  role  many  years  ago.  In  your  opinion,  how  would
                         Alvar be different from the other Conquistadors?























                                                                                                        67]]></page><page Index="73"><![CDATA[Cabeza de Vaca Exercise Book

               History
               Biography: Francisco Pizarro (page 111)

                                                       Francisco Pizarro (1476-1541) is the Spanish
                                                       Conquistador who conquered the Inca Empire
                                                       in  Peru.  Pizarro  is  believed  to  have  been
                                                       raised  in  poverty.  He  left  Spain  for  the  New
                                                       World  in  1502  and  lived  on  the  island  of
                                                       Hispañola.  While  in  Panama,  Pizarro  heard
                                                       about the riches of the Incas in Peru and set
                                                       out  to  conquer  their  empire.  In  1531,  he  set
                                                       sail from Panama with a small force of under
                                                       200 men. They crossed the rugged mountains
               into Peru and invited the Emperor Atahualpa for a meeting. Instead of talking, the
               Spaniards  staged  a  surprise  attack  against  the  Incas.  Although  the  Incas
               outnumbered  the  Spaniards  by  far,  they  were  quickly  defeated.  Atahualpa  was
               captured alive and held for ransom. Pizarro received huge quantities of gold and
               silver in exchange for the emperor, but he still had him executed. He then took over
               the entire empire and built a capital in Lima in 1535. Pizarro was assassinated in
               1541 after a power struggle with another Spaniard over the rule of Peru.

                   1.  Why did Pizarro decide to conquer Peru?



                   2.  How was such a small Spanish force able to defeat the Inca Empire?

                      [-D-] They tricked their enemies.

                      [-E-] They attacked at night.

                   3.  How did the Incas try to save their emperor’s life?






                   4.  How would you describe Pizarro’s methods of conquering?

                      [-A-] loving
                      [-B-] sympathetic
                      [-C-] harmless

                  History
                  Biography: Francisco Vasquez de Coronado (page 117)

                  Francisco Vasquez de Coronado (1510-1544) was a Spanish explorer famous for
                  his exploration of the southwestern United States.
                  Coronado  was  born  to  a  noble  family  in  Spain.  In  1535,  he  traveled  to  Mexico
                  where he married the daughter of the Spanish treasurer and became governor of a
                  major province. In Mexico, he heard accounts about the “Seven Cities of Cibola,”
                  and the travels of Cabeza de Vaca. That was when he decided to lead an expedition
                  of about three hundred Spanish soldiers and one thousand Natives north.
                  Although he managed to conquer Cibola, Coronado was disappointed to only find a
                  handful of Zuñi villages and no gold. From there he carried out another search that
                  led him all the way to the Colorado River, exploring the Grand Canyon and parts of
                  New  Mexico.  He  led  a  search  party  looking  for  the  mythical  city  of  Quivira  in
                  present-day  Kansas,  but  again  was  met  with  disappointment.  Disheartened  and
                  bankrupt,  Coronado  returned  to  Mexico  where  his  expedition  was  declared  a
                  failure. He resumed his post as governor and continued to live in Mexico until his
                  death in 1554.


                      1.  Why did Coronado think he would find treasures in the American southwest?






                      2.  Instead of finding gold, what did Coronado discover?

                         [-A-] the Zuñi culture
                         [-B-] The Colorado River
                         [-C-] The Grand Canyon
                         [-D-] New Mexico

                         [-E-] all of the above
